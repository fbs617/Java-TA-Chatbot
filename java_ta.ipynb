    "If the question is about bugs, compilation errors, or design, point to patterns, methods, or design tips from the context material.\n",
    "🎓 Teaching Style:\n",
    "Be professional, supportive, and clear — like a trusted lab demonstrator or tutor.\n",
    "Prioritize conceptual clarity over fancy language.\n",
    "Avoid filler. Never speculate.\n",
    "Structure your answer to help students understand, not just memorize.\n",

    "If yes, adapt and use it.\n",
    "If no, say: “Sorry, I couldn’t find that in the course material I was given.” and follow up with some counter questions related to the user question to make the user help you understand their question better.\n",

      "Brief Summary\n",
      "Java provides three main types of loops: `while`, `do-while`, and `for` loops, each serving different purposes for controlling the flow of execution based on conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Detailed Explanation\n",
      "1. **While Loop**: \n",
      "   - The `while` loop repeatedly executes a block of code as long as the specified boolean expression evaluates to `true`. The loop body can be executed zero or more times.\n",
      "   - Syntax:\n",
      "     ```java\n",
      "     while (boolean-expression) {\n",
      "         // Loop body\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - Example:\n",
      "     ```java\n",
      "     int counter = 0;\n",
      "     while (counter < 10) {\n",
      "         System.out.println(\"Hello \" + counter);\n",
      "         counter++;\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - This loop prints \"Hello\" followed by numbers 0 through 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Do-While Loop**:\n",
      "   - The `do-while` loop is similar to the `while` loop but guarantees that the loop body is executed at least once because the boolean expression is evaluated after the loop body.\n",
      "   - Syntax:\n",
      "     ```java\n",
      "     do {\n",
      "         // Loop body\n",
      "     } while (boolean-expression);\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - Example:\n",
      "     ```java\n",
      "     int counter = 0;\n",
      "     do {\n",
      "         System.out.println(\"Hello \" + counter);\n",
      "         counter++;\n",
      "     } while (counter < 10);\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - This loop also prints \"Hello\" followed by numbers 0 through 9, but ensures the loop body runs at least once.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **For Loop**:\n",
      "   - The `for` loop is often used for counting and iterating over arrays or collections. It consists of three parts: initialization (`init-exp`), condition (`test-exp`), and increment/decrement (`exp`).\n",
      "   - Syntax:\n",
      "     ```java\n",
      "     for (init-exp; test-exp; exp) {\n",
      "         // Loop body\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - Example:\n",
      "     ```java\n",
      "     for (int counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++) {\n",
      "         System.out.println(\"Hello \" + counter);\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - This loop initializes `counter` to 0, checks if `counter` is less than 10, and increments `counter` by 1 after each iteration.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Enhanced For Loop**:\n",
      "   - Used for iterating over arrays or collections without needing a loop counter.\n",
      "   - Syntax:\n",
      "     ```java\n",
      "     for (type element : array) {\n",
      "         // Loop body\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - Example:\n",
      "     ```java\n",
      "     int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n",
      "     for (int n : numbers) {\n",
      "         System.out.println(n);\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - This loop prints each element of the `numbers` array.\n",
      "\n",
      "Edge Cases & Pitfalls\n",
      "- Ensure that loop conditions eventually evaluate to `false` to avoid infinite loops.\n",
      "- Be cautious with loop variables and ensure they are updated correctly within the loop body.\n",
      "- Using `break` can exit a loop prematurely, while `continue` skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next.\n",
      "\n",
      "Optional Extras\n",
      "- **Break Statement**: Exits a loop immediately.\n",
      "  ```java\n",
      "  while (true) {\n",
      "      if (x > 10) {\n",
      "          break;\n",
      "      }\n",
      "  }\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "- **Continue Statement**: Skips the rest of the loop body and proceeds to the next iteration.\n",
      "  ```java\n",
      "  while (true) {\n",
      "      if (x < 4) {\n",
      "          continue;\n",
      "      }\n",
      "  }\n",
      "  ```\n"

Try entering negative as well as positive \\nnumbers. Consider writing one method to do the input and another to compute the average. Q1.3 Write a program to input 10 words, storing them as strings in an ArrayList<String> (not an \\narray), and then display the words in reverse sorted order. Q1.4 Write a program to generate 10000 random doubles between -0.9999999 and +0.9999999. Print out the largest, smallest and the average values. Do you need an array? Think very carefully about this. Hint: Look at the documentation for class Random and find the method nextDouble. Another hint: Negative values?? Class Random also has nextBoolean... Note: Answers to the following questions involve writing programs consisting of two or more \\nmethods (not including the main method). Q1.5 Write a one-class program that has the following methods: \\n• a method that inputs and returns a double value, \\n• a method that takes two double parameters, adds them together and returns the square root of \\nthe result, \\n• a main method to create an object and call the other two methods, displaying the result of calling \\nthe second method. Q1.6 Repeat Q1.5 but store the double values in two instance variables rather than using \\nparameters. Hint: you will need another instance method to call the input method to get values to store in each \\ninstance variable and to call the other methods. This instance method should be public, the others \\nprivate. The input method should be unchanged.', 'Hint: you will need another instance method to call the input method to get values to store in each \\ninstance variable and to call the other methods.

Q1.7 Write a method: public String toBase(int n, int b) that converts n to its String representation in \\nnumber base b, i.e., toBase(3,2) will return \"11\". Put the method into a one-class program that \\nallows you to input values and use the method. Q1.8 Write methods to do the following: \\n• Convert from millimetres to feet. • Convert from metres to inches. • Convert from kilometres to yards. COMP0004 Notes and Exercises 1 \\n-3- \\nInclude the methods in an interactive program that lets the user select which conversion to \\nperform, and then inputs a value and displays the result.

A loop will \\ncontinually redisplay the menu until the user selects Quit (number 4) to terminate the program. Notes: The conversion methods should take the value to be converted as a parameter and return a \\nresult. They should not do any input or display the result.

The FileInput .class file needs to be in the same directory as the program you are working on. Copy FileInput.class to all directories containing programs that need to use it. Q1.12 Write a program using methods that copies and reverses a text file (i.e., so that the \\ndestination file contains a backwards copy of the original file contents). This program will need both the FileInput and FileOutput classes (described in separate notes). Q1.13 Further modify the palindrome program to read a file containing strings (one per line) and \\nchecking whether each string is a palindrome.

Any range can be used, including the use of negative numbers, and the program must \\ncorrectly determine the values in the range. Note that Java does not support ranges directly like \\nGroovy does. Q1.16  Write a method that takes two character array parameters and returns true if both arrays \\ncontain the same characters but not necessarily in the same order. Note, character arrays are of \\ntype char[]. Harder Questions \\nYou may have previously written C programs to answer these questions, try them again in Java \\nand compare your code with your C version. Q1.17 Write a method to test if an integer of type long is a prime number. The method should \\nreturn a boolean value.', 'Q1.17 Write a method to test if an integer of type long is a prime number. The method should \\nreturn a boolean value. Test your method by writing a test one-class program that reads an integer \\ntyped at the keyboard and states whether the integer was prime.

Notes: This is not quite as easy as it might appear, especially if you want the program to produce \\nresults quickly. Search the web for information about prime numbers and algorithms for finding \\nthem - there are some excellent web sites. Q1.18 Write a program that reads an integer between 0 and 999 and \"verbalises it\". For example, \\nif the program is given 123 it would display \"one hundred and twenty three\".

The \\nclass provides a collection of useful input methods that you can call from your Exercise \\nQuestion programs, without having to manage Java exceptions until they are introduced \\nlater in the module. Treat class Input as a useful ‘Toy’ class that allows you to get started \\nwith Java programming, but don’t carry on using it once you have learnt more about Java. The original version of this class was written for use with the textbook Developing Java \\nSoftware (1st, 2nd and 3rd editions), which is now out of print but you may want to take a look \\nat. The current version has been quite extensively rewritten to take advantage more recent \\nJava developments, and requires Java 21 or later to work. Using class Input you can write interactive programs to run from the command line, or within \\nthe IDE, that are able to input values of the following types:  \\n• \\nint \\n• \\nlong \\n• \\ndouble \\n• \\nfloat \\n• \\nchar \\n• \\nString \\n• \\nBigInteger \\n• \\nBigDecimal  \\nA value has to be typed in the correct format for that type. For example, 123 would be a valid \\nint value but xyz would not be. Reading input is always tricky as you have to deal with all the \\nstrange things that someone may type in! If something is typed in that cannot be recognised as a value of the type being asked for, \\nthen an error message is displayed but the program carries on running. However, the \\nfollowing input is likely to not work correctly as the input buffer won’t contain the expected \\ncontent – remember using scanf with C and the idea of the scanf input buffer. Using class Input  \\nTo use class Input either create a file called Input.java in your IDE project and copy/paste \\nthe source code into it, or drag/drop an existing copy of the file into the project src directory. Note that Input is spelt using a capital 'I' and you must use the same combination of upper \\nand lower case letters. If an interactive program using class Input is run within the IDE then the Run View displaying \\nthe output will act like a terminal window displaying the text being output and reading input \\nfrom the keyboard.\", 'If an interactive program using class Input is run within the IDE then the Run View displaying \\nthe output will act like a terminal window displaying the text being output and reading input \\nfrom the keyboard. The Run View is usually displayed in the lower part of the IDE window. Outside of the IDE a program must be run from a command line in a Terminal window, in the \\nsame way as a C program. Change to the correct directory and use the java command (e.g., \\njava MyInteractiveProgram). Conveniently, though, you can open a Terminal panel inside the \\nIDE rather than using a separate terminal program. - 2 - \\nA program that needs to do input first has to create an Input object using the Input class. Do \\nthis by having a line in your program that looks like this:  \\nInput input = new Input(); \\nThis line must appear before you do any input and will give you a variable called input that \\nreferences an Input object. The examples use the variable name input but you can use any \\nvalid and relevant name. Only one Input object should be created in a program, otherwise \\nyou end up with two or more objects trying to read from the same keyboard! Once you have an Input object you call its methods to input values. For example, to input an \\ninteger you would use:  \\nint x = in.nextInt(); \\nWhen this statement is evaluated, the program will wait for you to type in some input. The \\ninput must be finished by pressing the <return> key, otherwise nothing more will happen! Once the input has been read an attempt will be made to recognise the characters that were \\ntyped in as an integer of type int. If successful, the int value will be returned and the variable \\nx initialised. If not, then the program will print out an error message like: \\n\"InputMismatchException: Input does not match expected int type.\" and return a default value, zero, the null character (‘/0’), false or an empty string depending \\non what you were trying to input. The program will carry on running but the contents of the \\ninput buffer will be left unchanged and will most likely result in the rest of the input not \\nworking as expected. To let someone using your program know that input is expected, it is a good idea to print a \\nprompt asking for the input.', 'To let someone using your program know that input is expected, it is a good idea to print a \\nprompt asking for the input. For example:  \\nSystem.out.print(\"Type a floating point number: \"); \\ndouble d = in.nextDouble(); \\nNote the use of print, rather than println, so that the input follows the message on the same \\nline. The following test program shows the use of some of the input methods provided by the \\nclass. To run this program, save the source code to a file called InputTest.java and compile \\nand run it, having first made sure that a copy of Input.class is in the same directory. public class InputTest \\n{ \\n  public void inputNumbers() \\n  { \\n    Input input = new Input(); \\n    System.out.print(\"Type an integer: \"); \\n    int n = input.nextInt(); \\n    System.out.println(\"Integer was: \" + n); \\n    System.out.print(\"Type a long: \"); \\n    long l = input.nextLong(); \\n    System.out.println(\"Long was: \" + l); \\n    System.out.print(\"Type a double: \"); \\n    double d = input.nextDouble(); \\n    System.out.println(\"Double was: \" + d); \\n    System.out.print(\"Type a float: \"); \\n \\n- 3 - \\n    float f = input.nextFloat(); \\n    System.out.println(\"float was: \" + f); \\n    // Note this extra input needed to remove the newline \\n    // left after reading the float. input.nextLine(); \\n    System.out.print(\"Type a word: \"); \\n    String s = input.nextLine(); \\n    System.out.println(\"Word was: \" + s); \\n    System.out.print(\"Type a single character: \"); \\n    char c = input.nextChar(); \\n    System.out.println(\"Character was: \" + c); \\n  } \\n  public static void main(String[] args) \\n  { \\n    new InputTest().inputNumbers(); \\n  } \\n}  \\nMethods named next<type> (for example, nextInt), attempt to read a value of the specified \\ntype. Any whitespace characters (space, tab, newline) before the actual value characters are \\nignored. For each next<type> method there is also a hasNext<type> method, for example hasNextInt.', 'Any whitespace characters (space, tab, newline) before the actual value characters are \\nignored. For each next<type> method there is also a hasNext<type> method, for example hasNextInt. These methods return true if the next non-whitespace characters typed in represent a value \\nof the specified type, false otherwise. If there is no input available, calling a hasNext method \\nwill wait for the user to type something in and press <return>. Input Buffering  \\nInput from the keyboard is buffered in an input buffer managed by other classes in the Java \\nclass libraries. This means that the characters typed when you are prompted to enter a value \\nare collected up and temporarily stored until the <return> key is pressed. Your program is \\nkept waiting while you are typing, so your program is not actually doing anything. Only after \\nthe <return> key is pressed does your program carry on running. While your program is \\nwaiting we say it is suspended or blocked. As a result of the buffering your program receives a whole line of characters at a time, not \\nsingle characters one after another as they are typed. The line of characters includes a \\nnewline character at the end — newline is the character generated by pressing <return>. When you input a value using a next method like nextInt, an attempt is made convert the \\ncharacters in the buffer to a value of the right type, in the order the characters appear. For \\nexample, if the buffer contains:  \\n123\\\\n  \\n(where \\\\n is a newline) then the characters \\'1\\', \\'2\\' and \\'3\\' are read and converted to 123. Whitespace characters (spaces, tabs, newlines) before the 123 are skipped, so:  \\n123\\\\n  \\nor  \\n\\\\n123\\\\n  \\n \\n- 4 - \\nalso results in 123 being input. If there are non-digit characters that are not whitespace \\nbefore the input value, the input will fail with a default value of zero returned:  \\nab 123\\\\n  \\nThe characters \"ab\" cannot be converted to an int (in base 10), so input fails and the \\ncharacters are left in the buffer. Even if there are characters that represent a valid integer \\nlater in the buffer they will not be seen or read. If the input buffer contains:  \\n123 456\\\\n  \\nthen getting an int value using nextInt will return 123, leaving the rest of the characters in the \\ninput buffer.', 'If the input buffer contains:  \\n123 456\\\\n  \\nthen getting an int value using nextInt will return 123, leaving the rest of the characters in the \\ninput buffer. Inputting another int will read 456 without the program waiting for the user to \\ntype more input as the buffer already contains an integer. If a program prompts the user to type in two integers, one after another, at the first prompt \\nthe user can enter:  \\n123\\\\n  \\nThen at the second prompt:  \\n456\\\\n  \\nWhen the first int is read the \\\\n is left in the input buffer. When the second int is read, the \\\\n \\nin the input buffer is skipped over as it is whitespace. The program will then wait for the input \\nbuffer to be filled again by the user typing the next integer. This highlights that the next input \\nalways starts with the current contents of the buffer. The program will only wait for the user \\nto type more input when the buffer needs to be filled. If a program does not wait for input \\nwhen you expected it to, then you need to take into account this behaviour when working out \\nwhat is happening. Using the nextLine method will return a String containing the entire contents of the buffer \\n(i.e., an entire line of text). The newline character is read and discarded, leaving the buffer \\nempty. If nextLine is called when the buffer is already empty, the program will wait until \\nsomething is typed in. The nextChar method can be used to read a single character from the buffer. Reading a \\nnewline character, returns the newline, hence it is not discarded as when using nextLine. Getting Valid Input  \\nA loop can be used to repeatedly ask for and then check the input until the user enters \\nsomething valid. This avoids the program terminating if the user enters invalid input, for \\nexample enters a word instead of a number.', 'Getting Valid Input  \\nA loop can be used to repeatedly ask for and then check the input until the user enters \\nsomething valid. This avoids the program terminating if the user enters invalid input, for \\nexample enters a word instead of a number. The following code asks the user to type in ‘y’ or ‘n’ (short for yes or no) and keeps doing so \\nuntil the user does actually type ‘y’ or ‘n’:  \\nInput input = new Input(); \\nString reply = \"\"; \\n \\n- 5 - \\ndo \\n{ \\n  System.out.print(\"Do you want to continue (y/n): \"); \\n  reply = input.nextLine(); \\n} while (!reply.equals(\"y\") && !reply.equals(\"n\")); \\nSystem.out.println(\"You typed: \" + reply); \\nNote that the nextLine method is used to read an entire line of input. If the input contains \\nanything other than the single characters required, the loop continues. The newline \\ncharacter is ignored. The next example asks the user to input an integer value and repeats until the user enters a \\nsequence of digits that can be converted into a value of type int:  \\nwhile (true) { \\n  System.out.print(\"Enter an integer: \"); \\n   if (input.hasNextInt()) { \\n     int n = input.nextInt(); \\n     System.out.println(\"You typed: \" + n); \\n     break; \\n   } \\n input.nextLine(); // Input and discard current line. System.out.println(\"You did not type an integer! Try again. \"); \\n}  \\nNote the use of the hasNextInt method to check if the input buffer contents can actually be \\nconverted to an int. The nextInt method should be called only if hasNextInt returns true to \\navoid the program printing an error message and nextInt returning a default value rather \\nthan what was meant to be input. Also note the call to the nextLine method to empty the \\ninput buffer between each attempt to read the input. Values of other types can be input using \\nthe appropriate next and hasNext methods. Error Messages \\nWhen any attempt to read input fails, usually when the user of the program doesn’t enter \\nwhat was asked for, then an error message will be displayed on the standard error (stderr) \\noutput stream. By default, this simply displays the error message in the terminal window or \\nRun View you are using. These messages will be interspersed with the normal output.', 'By default, this simply displays the error message in the terminal window or \\nRun View you are using. These messages will be interspersed with the normal output. If you \\nare using the Run View in the IDE, any text printed to stderr will appear in red. For example, using the InputTest example class from earlier: \\nType an integer: abc \\nInteger was: 0 \\nInputMismatchException: Input does not match expected int type. Here the user didn’t enter characters that could be converted to an int value, the default \\nvalue of zero we returned, and the error message printed out. In addition, no input has been \\nread so the buffer still contains ‘abc’, and the program carries on running. Looking at an extended version of the output, you see this: \\nType an integer: abc \\nInteger was: 0 \\nInputMismatchException: Input does not match expected int type. InputMismatchException: Input does not match expected long type. - 6 - \\nInputMismatchException: Input does not match expected double type. InputMismatchException: Input does not match expected float type. Type a long: Long was: 0 \\nType a double: Double was: 0.0 \\nType a float: float was: 0.0 \\n \\nThe program continues to try and input a long, double and then float, but as the ‘abc’ is left in \\nthe buffer, all three inputs also fail, with the default zero values returned. Each failed input \\nresults in an error message being printed but notice the order in which the printing has \\noccurred. Stdout and stderr are two separate output streams so what they print will be \\ninterleaved depending on which output gets written out first. This is due to the way that \\noutput is buffered. This all means that when using Input with your programs, you will see the error messages if \\ninvalid input is entered, but the order of the error messages and normal output may not be \\nwhat you expect.', '© 2021, Graham Roberts\\nUCL COMPUTER SCIENCE\\nObject\\nInitialisation\\n© 2021, Graham Roberts\\nUCL COMPUTER SCIENCE\\n2\\nInitialisation\\n• We have seen that constructors can be used to \\ninitialise instance variables. • Both class and instance variables can also be directly \\ninitialised by initialisation expressions. • private int x = 2;\\n• private static String = “Hello”;\\n© 2021, Graham Roberts\\nUCL COMPUTER SCIENCE\\n3\\nInitialisation (2)\\n• And also by an initialiser block\\n– Declared in a class outside of any methods. private Stack x;\\n{ x = new Stack(); x.push(1); x.push(2);}\\n• A static initialiser block can be used for static \\nvariables. private static Stack x;\\nstatic { x = new Stack(); x.push(1); x.push(2);}\\n© 2021, Graham Roberts\\nUCL COMPUTER SCIENCE\\n4\\nChoosing\\n• 3 ways to initialise - how do you choose? • No single answer but:\\n– aim to initialise a variable as close to the point of declaration \\nas possible. – or group all initialisation into the constructor, so it is all in the \\nsame place. • Be consistent. • Follow the coding style.', '© UCL CS 2025.

Write a program to read in a day, month and year, create an object to represent the \\ndate, and output the result as a formatted string (e.g., 2022-01-01). Use a class in the Java \\nclass library to represent and store the date. Hint: There is a Date class but this is not what you want. Instead, look at the JavaDoc \\ndocumentation for the Calendar class (e.g., Calendar.getInstance or Calendar.set), and also \\nthe SimpleDateFormat class for formatting dates to display. The JavaDoc explains how to use \\nthese classes, with some examples. The main purpose of this question is to investigate the date related classes available in the \\nstandard Java class library. If you do this you discover that there seem to be quite a few \\nclasses and it all looks a bit complicated. This is due to the fact that representing and \\nmanipulating dates and time really is complicated! Up to Java 8 the main classes were Date to represent an instance in time and \\nGregorianCalendar to represent time in days, months and years, second,  minutes and \\nhours. GregorianCalendar is a subclass of the abstract class Calendar, specialised to \\nrepresent the standard calendar system used by most of the world, which is the Gregorian \\ncalendar. It supports the representation and manipulation of dates in year, month, day, \\nhour, minute, and second formats. The class handles various complexities of the calendar \\nsystem, such as leap years, time zones, and daylight-saving transitions. Additionally, \\nGregorianCalendar offers methods to compute things like the week of the year and \\nsupports modification of date and time values within a valid range for each value. From Java 8 onwards, a new and significantly improved package of time and date classes \\ncalled java.time was added to Java. Class LocalDate in that package represents a date \\n(year, month, day) using the ISO-8601 standard calendar system, ignoring time zones \\n(geographical regions with the same date and time). It doesn’t represent time (hours, \\nminutes, seconds) but is suitable for handling dates like birthdays or holidays that don't \\nrequire time or time zone information.\", 'It doesn’t represent time (hours, \\nminutes, seconds) but is suitable for handling dates like birthdays or holidays that don\\'t \\nrequire time or time zone information. LocalDate provides various utility methods for date \\nmanipulation, such as adding or subtracting days, comparing dates, and creating instances \\nfrom string representations or specific year, month, and day values. While classes GregorianCalendar and LocalDate allow dates and time to be \\nrepresented by objects, they don’t generate string representations that can be displayed or \\nstored as text. Instead, there are various formatting classes that can generate string \\nrepresentations, and like representing date and time values a wide variety of formats are \\nused to display a date or the time as a string. Different countries officially use different date formats, while there are plenty of other \\nvariations in common use. A locale is used to define the specific formats for different \\nlanguages, regions, or cultures. Various codes are used to identify a locale, such as the \\n \\n- 2 - \\nlanguage in the form of two or three lowercase letters, including \"en\" for English or \"fr\" for \\nFrench. A country or region is identified using two upper case letters, for example \"GB\", \\n\"US\" or \"FR\". Locales are used to format data (like dates, numbers, and currencies) according to local \\nconventions, translate text in applications, and manage other locale-specific data such as \\nsorting rules and, as we are interested in here, calendar preferences. This enables a \\nprogrammer to write code that will manage and display locale information in the right \\nformat. For straightforward date string formatting class SimpleDateFormat is available, and it \\ntakes into account locale information. The class can also convert a string to a Date object \\nvalue. However,  SimpleDateFormat has effectively been replace by class \\nDateTimeFormatter from Java 8 onwards and should be used in preference for new \\ndevelopment work, as it has a better design and more advanced formatting capabilities. Class SimpleDateFormat is a good example of a class that remains in the standard class \\nlibrary for backward compatibility and to avoid breaking older code (referred to as legacy \\ncode). For a full description of the classes described above go to the JavaDoc documentation \\nonline, or ask ChatGPT or CoPilot for examples.', 'For a full description of the classes described above go to the JavaDoc documentation \\nonline, or ask ChatGPT or CoPilot for examples. The JavaDoc for Java 21 is here: \\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/index.html \\nUse the search field at the top left to find the classes you are interested in. In addition to the standard Java classes, there are some open-source libraries for working \\nwith dates and time. The best known is Joda Time, https://www.joda.org/joda-time/, \\noriginally developed as a better alternative to the facilities provided up to Java 8. However, \\nwith the development of the improved java.time package classes from Java 8 onwards \\nJoda Time development stopped as it was no longer really needed.

What is a POM ﬁle? A Maven Project Object Model (POM) ﬁle is an XML format ﬁle that serves as the core \\nconﬁguration ﬁle for a Maven-based project. The POM ﬁle deﬁnes how a project is built, \\nspecifying details such as the build process, plugins, repositories, and dependency \\nmanagement, along with metadata including the project’s name and version. This \\nallows Maven to automate tasks such as compiling code, running tests, packaging \\napplications, and managing dependencies eUiciently. A key feature of a POM ﬁle is dependency management. Instead of manually \\ndownloading and maintaining code libraries, developers can declare dependencies in \\nthe POM ﬁle, and Maven automatically fetches them from a repository like the Maven \\nCentral Repository (https://mvnrepository.com). Additionally, POM ﬁles support \\ninheritance and modularisation, making it easier to manage large-scale projects by \\nallowing child projects to inherit conﬁgurations from a parent POM. The Maven POM \\nsimpliﬁes project setup and ensures consistency across builds. Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a structured, human-readable format used to \\nstore and transport data. It deﬁnes a set of rules for encoding documents in a way that \\nis both machine-readable and human-readable. XML uses a hierarchical structure with \\nnested elements enclosed in tags, similar to HTML, but it is more ﬂexible because it \\nallows users to deﬁne their own tags. This ﬂexibility makes XML a widely used format for \\nconﬁguration ﬁles, data exchange between systems, and structured document storage. Maven uses XML for POM ﬁles because XML provides a standardized and structured \\nway to represent conﬁguration data. XML’s hierarchical nature makes it well-suited for \\ndeﬁning complex conﬁgurations such as project dependencies, build settings, and \\nplugins in an organized manner.', 'XML’s hierarchical nature makes it well-suited for \\ndeﬁning complex conﬁgurations such as project dependencies, build settings, and \\nplugins in an organized manner. Additionally, since XML is a widely adopted format, \\nmany tools and frameworks can easily parse and manipulate POM ﬁles, ensuring \\ninteroperability across diUerent development environments. The use of XML also allows \\nMaven conﬁgurations to be both human-readable and easily editable, while still being \\nmachine-processable for automation. One of the key principles of Maven is its declarative approach, which means that \\ninstead of specifying step-by-step instructions on how to build a project, a POM ﬁle \\nsimply declares what the project requires. For example, rather than writing scripts to \\nmanually download dependencies and compile code, a developer only needs to specify \\ndependencies and plugins in the POM ﬁle, and Maven takes care of the rest. This \\nsimpliﬁes project management and reduces the need for custom build scripts, making \\n \\n- 2 - \\ndevelopment more eUicient and less error-prone. By relying on convention over \\nconﬁguration, Maven ensures consistency across projects while allowing developers to \\nfocus on writing code rather than managing builds. The JavaWebAppExample POM File \\n \\nThe example web application is set up as a Maven project with a POM ﬁle named \\npom.xml, which is the usual default name used for POM ﬁles. POM File Layout Overview \\nThe top-level layout of pom.xml is: \\n• Project Declaration and Metadata \\no Model version, Group ID, Artifact ID, Version \\no Packaging type, Name, URL \\n• Properties \\no Custom properties (e.g., compiler versions) \\n• Build  \\no Plugins and their conﬁgurations used to run a build process. • Dependencies \\no List of dependencies \\nThe entire content is written in XML format, with each item tagged in html style, for \\nexample: \\n<groupId>an id</groupId> \\nEach opening tag has to be matched with a closing tag, starting with ‘/’, and tags are \\nbracketed using ‘<’ and ‘>’. A complete section with opening and closing tags is referred \\nto as an element, and elements have to be nested correctly.', 'A complete section with opening and closing tags is referred \\nto as an element, and elements have to be nested correctly. For example, you cannot \\nhave a parent closing tag before all the nested elements’ closing tags have appeared. The following sub-sections describe what each part of the example pom.xml does. Root Element \\n<project xmlns=http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 \\n         xmlns:xsi=http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance \\n         xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 \\n                  http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\"> \\n \\n... Rest of file \\n \\n</project> \\n \\nThe project element is the top-level element that contains everything else. It must be \\npresent for a POM ﬁle to be valid. xmlns=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0\" \\n• xmlns stands for XML Namespace. - 3 - \\n• This declares the default namespace for the document, a bit like a scope. • The elements (tags) that are available to use in the namespace are deﬁned by the \\nMaven POM 4.0.0 schema xsd ﬁle (see below). • The URL is used as the name or identiﬁer for the namespace. It is not an actual \\nﬁle that can be downloaded (try it in a web-browser and you get a 404 error). This \\nallows tools such as parsers or editors to know what kind of document they are \\nworking with. For example, without this namespace an XML parser wouldn’t \\nrecognize the elements as part of a Maven POM ﬁle, and wouldn’t be able to \\nprocess the content correctly. xmlns:xsi=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" \\n• xmlns:xsi deﬁnes a namespace preﬁx for xsi, which stands for XML Schema \\nInstance. • The URL is also just an identiﬁer, there is no ﬁle to download. • This schema enables XML documents to reference and use schema validation \\nrules, ensuring they follow a deﬁned structure.', '• The URL is also just an identiﬁer, there is no ﬁle to download. • This schema enables XML documents to reference and use schema validation \\nrules, ensuring they follow a deﬁned structure. • A schema deﬁnition is associated with this identiﬁer, but the deﬁnition is built \\ninto tools like parsers and doesn’t need to be downloaded. Even so, the identiﬁer \\nmust still be included. xsi:schemaLocation=\"http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 \\nhttp://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd\" \\n• This links the namespace identiﬁer (http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0) to the \\nactual location where the corresponding schema can be downloaded from \\n(http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd). • The downloaded schema can then be used for tasks such as validating that the \\nstructure of the POM ﬁle is correct. Other Metadata \\n• This speciﬁes the model version of the POM, which must be 4.0.0 for Maven 2 \\nand later. This will only change if a new model is introduced in a future version of \\nMaven. <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion> \\n \\n• A group is a collection of related projects, for example the projects belonging to \\nan organisation like UCL. Often a reverse domain name is used for the group \\nidentiﬁer, in this case uk.ac.ucl, with the aim of avoiding clashes with projects \\nfrom other organisations. This element adds the example project to the speciﬁed group. You can use your \\nown group identiﬁer instead of this one. <groupId>uk.ac.ucl</groupId> \\n \\n- 4 - \\n \\n• The name of the project, also used in the naming of project artifacts (things that \\nget created), such as a jar or war ﬁles. <artifactId>WebApp</artifactId> \\n \\n• The current version of the project. The version number has to be updated \\nmanually.', \"<artifactId>WebApp</artifactId> \\n \\n• The current version of the project.

In this case, 'war' \\nindicates this is a web application archive ﬁle. Maven will create the war ﬁle and \\nput it in the war-ﬁle directory in the project directory when the package lifecycle \\nphase is run. This is not strictly needed for the example project, but the war ﬁle \\ncould be copied to a separate web server for deployment. <packaging>war</packaging> \\n \\n• The “human readable” project name or title that can be displayed by tools and \\nused in documentation. It can be any name or title, and is not used by Maven for \\n \\n- 5 - \\nnaming any ﬁles or artifacts generated by a build process. This project reuses the \\nartifactID but it would be better to use something a bit more descriptive. <name>WebApp</name> \\n \\n• Project URL, typically pointing to documentation, Git repo, or futher information. In the case of the example project the given URL is simply the development URL \\nused to access the application when it is run. <url>http://localhost:8080</url> \\n \\n \\nProperties \\nThis section deﬁnes properties, which are used like constant variables, to deﬁne a value \\nin a single location, avoiding repetition and improving maintainability. • These give the version numbers for Tomcat, JSPs and the Java JDK. These \\nversions are known to work together, but by changing version numbers diUerent \\ncombinations can be used. It is important to have the correct JDK version, which \\nshould match the installed JDK used to run Maven and the application. <properties> \\n        <tomcat.version>11.0.4</tomcat.version> \\n        <jsp.version>4.0.1</jsp.version> \\n        <java.version>23</java.version> \\n \\n• This deﬁnes the minimum (oldest) version of Java that the source code should be \\nwritten for, considering the syntax and standard library version.\", 'In the case of the \\nexample project the version is set to the java.version property value. <maven.compiler.source>${java.version}</maven.compiler.source>  \\n \\n• Similarly, this deﬁnes the minimum (oldest) version of Java that should be used \\nto actually compile the code. This matters if the code is to be run on other \\nmachines using an older version of Java. If the code is compiled with a later \\nversion it won’t run. Again for the example project the version is set to the \\njava.version property value. <maven.compiler.target>${java.version}</maven.compiler.target>  \\n \\n• This gives the fully qualiﬁed name of the class containing the main method used \\nto start the application when it is run. Fully qualiﬁed means that the full package \\nname is added before the class name. <main.class>ucl.ac.uk.main.Main</main.class>  \\n \\n \\n- 6 - \\n• This gives the character encoding for the Java source ﬁles. UTF-8 is the usual \\ndefault, as Java source code is most frequently written in ASCII. However, Java \\nsource ﬁles can be written in other languages using a diUerent character \\nencoding, and this allows those ﬁles to be compiled via Maven. <project.build.sourceEncoding> \\n       UTF-8 \\n     </project.build.sourceEncoding> \\n \\nBuild and Plugins \\nThe <build> section is used to conﬁgure how the build process works, using a sequence \\nof plugins that control diUerent parts of the process. Strictly not all the plugins deﬁned \\nhere are needed in this POM ﬁle as the defaults will be satisfactory. However, some are \\nneeded in order to provide speciﬁc details needed for this project. Others are included \\nto illustrate the range of plugins. Each plugin has a version, and the versions need to be compatible with each other, but \\nthere is quite a lot of ﬂexibility. One purpose of specifying all the plugins and their \\nversions is to prevent incompatibilities occurring as the project is developed over time. For example, if more development takes place a year later the build will still work, rather \\nthan getting side-tracked into having to ﬁx version errors. • These are the tags used at the start of the build section.', 'For example, if more development takes place a year later the build will still work, rather \\nthan getting side-tracked into having to ﬁx version errors. • These are the tags used at the start of the build section. <build> \\n       <plugins> \\n \\n• Plugin to generate a WAR ﬁle for web applications, allowing the location of the \\nwar ﬁle to be speciﬁed. ${basedir} is a property automatically set by Maven with \\nthe location of the project directory.

It ensures that \\nnon-code ﬁles (e.g., conﬁguration ﬁles, properties ﬁles, images, XML, etc.) are \\nproperly processed, moved to the correct locations, and included in the ﬁnal \\nbuild output. For example, images and icons needed by an application get \\ncopied into the correct directory that the working program needs. <plugin> \\n        <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId> \\n        <artifactId>maven-resources-plugin</artifactId> \\n        <version>3.3.1</version> \\n      </plugin> \\n \\n• Check that the correct version of Java is being used and that the features used in \\nthe source code are supported by that Java version.

Hint: You compare strings using compareTo, as outlined in the preceding notes. Answer:\\nThe answer uses a do-while loop, where the loop body is evaluated at least once. This is an \\nexample of where the do-while loop is a better solution than a while or for loop, as the loop body \\nalways needs to be evaluated at least once and the boolean condition evaluated after an attempt \\nat input has been made. It also avoids needing to duplicate the prompt message and input code \\nbefore the loop body. public class Q1\\n{\\n  public void inputUntilStopIsTyped()\\n  {\\n    Input input = new Input();\\n    String in;\\n    do\\n    {\\n      System.out.print\\n        (\"Enter some text, type \\'stop\\' to exit the program: \");\\n      in = input.nextLine();\\n      System.out.println(\"You typed: \" + in);\\n    } while (in.compareTo(\"stop\") != 0);\\n  }\\n  public static void main(String[] args)\\n  {\\n    new Q1().inputUntilStopIsTyped();\\n  }\\n}\\nThe boolean expression could also be written as !in.equals(“stop”)\\nQ1.2 Write a program to input 10 doubles (values of type double) and store them in an array.

Knowing what is in the class library can make writing code a lot easier! You might wonder what Collections.reverseOrder() actually is. One way to find out, of course(! ), is \\nto use the Java Documentation (JavaDoc). This will tell you that reverseOrder is a static (class) \\nmethod that returns a Comparator object implementing the Comparable interface. A comparator is \\nused to compare two values based on their defined ordering, and is actually an object wrapping a \\ncomparison method. Collections.sort uses a comparator object to compare values when sorting \\nrather than having a fixed built in way of comparing values, which would only work for one type of \\nvalue. By sorting using a comparator a single sort implementation can sort values of any type if \\ngiven a suitable comparator, with the constraint that all values being sorted have to have the same \\ntype (or be comparable in a systematic way). - -\\n4\\nCOMP0004 Notes and Exercises 1\\nQ1.4 Write a program to generate 10000 random doubles between -0.9999999 and +0.9999999.

Test your method by writing a test one-class program that reads an integer typed at \\nthe keyboard and states whether the integer was prime. Answer:\\nA prime number is a positive integer that has two divisors only, the number 1 and the prime number \\nitself. The basic test for a prime number is to divide a candidate number by all the integers from 2 \\nup to the square root of the candidate number. If any divisions give a remainder of 0 then the \\nnumber is not prime. Several small optimisations can be made. Firstly any even number is immediately rejected by \\nchecking to see if dividing by two leaves a remainder of zero. Second, the search performed by the \\nwhile loop only tries to divide using odd numbers, as any multiple of an even number must be an \\neven number and hence not prime. public class Q17\\n{\\n  public boolean isPrime(long n)\\n  {\\n    if (n < 2L)\\n    {\\n      return false;\\n    }\\n    if (n == 2L)\\n    {\\n      return true;\\n    }\\n    if ((n % 2L) == 0)\\n    {\\n      return false;\\n    }\\n    long divisor = 3L;\\n    final long limit = new Double(Math.sqrt(n)).longValue();\\n    while (divisor <= limit)\\n    {\\n      if ((n % divisor) == 0)\\n      {\\n        return false;\\n      }\\n      divisor += 2L;\\n    }\\n    return true;\\n  }\\n  public void checkPrime()\\n  {\\n    Input input = new Input();\\n    System.out.print(\"Enter a number: \");\\n-\\n-\\n24\\nCOMP0004 Notes and Exercises 1\\n    long candidate = input.nextLong();\\n    if (isPrime(candidate))\\n    {\\n      System.out.println(candidate + \" is a prime number! \");\\n    }\\n    else\\n    {\\n      System.out.println(candidate + \" is not a prime number. \");\\n    }\\n  }\\n  public static void main(final String[] args)\\n  {\\n    new Q17().checkPrime();\\n  }\\n}\\nThe method above performs a brute force test.', '\");\\n    }\\n  }\\n  public static void main(final String[] args)\\n  {\\n    new Q17().checkPrime();\\n  }\\n}\\nThe method above performs a brute force test.

Preface\\nvi\\n1\\nIntroduction to JShell\\nThe Java Shell tool (JShell) is an interactive tool for learning the Java programming language\\nand prototyping Java code. It was introduced in JDK 9. JShell is a Read-Evaluate-Print Loop\\ntool (REPL), which evaluates declarations, statements, and expressions as they are entered\\nand immediately shows the results. The tool is run from the command line. Topics\\n•\\nWhy Use JShell? •\\nStarting and Stopping JShell\\nFor reference information for this tool, see The jshell Command in Java Development Kit Tool\\nSpecifications. Why Use JShell? Using JShell, you can enter program elements one at a time, immediately see the result, and\\nmake adjustments as needed. Java program development typically involves the following process:\\n•\\nWrite a complete program. •\\nCompile it and fix any errors. •\\nRun the program. •\\nFigure out what is wrong with it. •\\nEdit it. •\\nRepeat the process. JShell helps you try out code and easily explore options as you develop your program. You can\\ntest individual statements, try out different variations of a method, and experiment with\\nunfamiliar APIs within a JShell session.\", 'JShell helps you try out code and easily explore options as you develop your program. You can\\ntest individual statements, try out different variations of a method, and experiment with\\nunfamiliar APIs within a JShell session. JShell doesn’t replace an IDE. As you develop your\\nprogram, paste code into JShell to try it out, and then paste working code from JShell into your\\nprogram editor or IDE. Starting and Stopping JShell\\nJShell was introduced in JDK 9. To start JShell, enter the jshell command on the command\\nline. JDK 9 or higher must be installed on your system. If your path doesn’t include the bin directory,\\nfor example java-home/jdk-16.0.1/bin, then start the tool from within that directory. The following example shows the command and the response from JShell. Text that you enter\\nis shown in bold:\\n% jshell\\n|  Welcome to JShell -- Version 17.0.1\\n1-1\\n|  For an introduction type: /help intro\\njshell>\\nThe examples in this tutorial use the verbose mode. Verbose mode is recommended as you\\nwork through this tutorial so that what you see matches the examples. When you are more\\nfamiliar with the tool, you might prefer to run in normal or a more concise mode. To start JShell in verbose mode, use the -v option:\\n% jshell -v\\nTo exit JShell, enter /exit:\\njshell> /exit\\n|  Goodbye\\nChapter 1\\nStarting and Stopping JShell\\n1-2\\n2\\nSnippets\\nJShell accepts Java statements; variable, method, and class definitions; imports; and\\nexpressions. These pieces of Java code are referred to as snippets. Topics\\n•\\nTrying Out Snippets\\n•\\nChanging Definitions\\n•\\nForward References\\n•\\nExceptions\\n•\\nTab Completion for Snippets\\n•\\nSnippet Transformation\\nTrying Out Snippets\\nSnippets of Java code are entered into JShell and immediately evaluated. Feedback about the\\nresults, actions performed, and any errors that occurred are shown. Use the examples in this\\nsection to give JShell a try.', 'Feedback about the\\nresults, actions performed, and any errors that occurred are shown. Use the examples in this\\nsection to give JShell a try. Start JShell with the verbose option to get the maximum amount of feedback available:\\n% jshell -v\\n|  Welcome to JShell -- Version 17.0.1\\n|  For an introduction type: /help intro\\nEnter the following sample statement at the prompt, and review the output that is shown:\\njshell> int x = 45\\nx ==> 45\\n|  created variable x : int\\nFirst, the result is shown. Read this as: the variable x has the value 45. Because you are in\\nverbose mode, a description of what occurred is also shown. Informative messages start with a\\nvertical bar. Notice that both the name and the type of the created variable are shown. Note:\\nTerminating semicolons are automatically added to the end of a complete snippet if\\nnot entered. When an expression is entered that doesn\\'t have a named variable, a scratch variable is\\ncreated so that its value can be referenced later. The following example shows scratch values\\n2-1\\nfor an expression and for the results of a method. The example also shows the continuation\\nprompt (...>) that is used when a snippet requires more than one line of input to complete:\\njshell> 2 + 2\\n$3 ==> 4\\n|  created scratch variable $3 : int\\njshell> String twice(String s) {\\n   ...>    return s + s;\\n   ...> }\\n|  created method twice(String)\\njshell> twice(\"Ocean\")\\n$5 ==> \"OceanOcean\"\\n|  created scratch variable $5 : String\\nChanging Definitions\\nAs you experiment with code, you might find that the definition of a variable, method, or class\\nisn’t doing what you want it to do. The definition is easily changed by entering a new one,\\nwhich overwrites the previous definition. To change the definition of a variable, method, or class, simply enter a new definition.', 'The definition is easily changed by entering a new one,\\nwhich overwrites the previous definition. To change the definition of a variable, method, or class, simply enter a new definition. For\\nexample, the twice method that was defined in Trying Out Snippets gets a new definition in the\\nfollowing example:\\njshell> String twice(String s) {\\n   ...>    return \"Twice:\" + s;\\n   ...> }\\n|  modified method twice(String)\\n|  update overwrote method twice(String)\\njshell> twice(\"thing\")\\n$7 ==> \"Twice:thing\"\\n|  created scratch variable $7 : String\\nNotice that instead of showing created method as before, the feedback shows modified\\nmethod. This message means that the definition changed, but the method has the same\\nsignature, and therefore all existing usages continue to be valid. You can also change definitions in incompatible ways. The following example shows x being\\nchanged from int to String:\\njshell> int x = 45\\nx ==> 45\\n|  created variable x : int\\njshell> String x\\nx ==> null\\n|  replaced variable x : String\\n|  update overwrote variable x : int\\nThe type of the variable x changed, and the feedback now shows replaced. Chapter 2\\nChanging Definitions\\n2-2\\nChanging the Level of Feedback\\nJShell was started in the verbose feedback mode, which provides a lot of commentary. You\\ncan set the amount and format of output with the /set feedback command, for example /set\\nfeedback concise. If you primarily use JShell by pasting from other windows, then you might\\nprefer a feedback mode with no prompt and only error feedback. If so, then enter the /set\\nfeedback silent command. Forward References\\nJShell accepts method definitions that reference methods, variables, or classes that aren’t yet\\ndefined. This is done to support exploratory programming and because some forms of\\nprogramming require it.', 'Forward References\\nJShell accepts method definitions that reference methods, variables, or classes that aren’t yet\\ndefined. This is done to support exploratory programming and because some forms of\\nprogramming require it. As an example, if you want to define a method for the volume of a sphere, then you can enter\\nthe following formula as the method volume:\\njshell> double volume(double radius) {\\n   ...>    return 4.0 / 3.0 * PI * cube(radius);\\n   ...> }\\n|  created method volume(double), however, it cannot be invoked until \\nvariable PI, and method cube(double) are declared\\nJShell allows the definition but warns of what is yet to be defined. The definition can be\\nreferenced, but if execution is attempted, then it fails until all of the required elements are\\ndefined:\\njshell> double PI = 3.1415926535\\nPI ==> 3.1415926535\\n|  created variable PI : double\\njshell> volume(2)\\n|  attempted to call method volume(double) which cannot be invoked until \\nmethod cube(double) is declared\\njshell> double cube(double x) { return x * x * x; }\\n|  created method cube(double)\\n|    update modified method volume(double)\\njshell> volume(2)\\n$5 ==> 33.510321637333334\\n|  created scratch variable $8 : double\\nWith all of the definitions in place, the volume method now works. This method is now used to illustrate more about incompatible replacement. For example, to\\nchange the precision of PI, enter the new value as shown in the following example:\\njshell> BigDecimal PI = new BigDecimal(\"3.141592653589793238462643383\")\\nPI ==> 3.141592653589793238462643383\\n|  replaced variable PI : BigDecimal\\n|    update modified method volume(double) which cannot be invoked until this \\nerror is corrected: \\nChapter 2\\nForward References\\n2-3\\n|      bad operand types for binary operator \\'*\\'\\n|        first type:  double\\n|        second type: java.math.BigDecimal\\n|          return 4.0 / 3.0 * PI * cube(radius);\\n|                 ^------------^\\n|    update overwrote variable PI : double\\nThe new definition of PI is type-incompatible with the definition of volume().', \"Because you are\\nin verbose mode, update information is shown for other definitions affected by the change,\\nwhich in this case describes the incompatibility. Notice that verbose mode is the only\\npredefined feedback mode that displays update information. In other feedback modes, no\\nwarning is displayed until the code is executed. The purpose of this is to prevent an overload of\\nupdates. In all predefined modes, executing the volume() method displays the issue:\\njshell> volume(2)\\n|  attempted to call method volume(double) which cannot be invoked until this \\nerror is corrected: \\n|      bad operand types for binary operator '*'\\n|        first type:  double\\n|        second type: java.math.BigDecimal\\n|          return 4.0 / 3.0 * PI * cube(radius);\\n|                 ^------------^\\nExceptions\\nIn an exception backtrace, feedback identifies the snippet and the location within the snippet\\nwhere the exception occurred. The location within the code entered into JShell is displayed as #ID:line-number, where\\nsnippet ID is the number displayed by the /list command, and line-number is the line number\\nwithin the snippet. In the following example, the exception occurs in snippet 1, which is the\\ndivide() method, on the second line of the method:\\njshell> int divide(int x, int y) {\\n   ...> return x / y;\\n   ...> }\\n|  created method divide(int,int)\\njshell> divide(5, 0)\\n|  java.lang.ArithmeticException thrown: / by zero\\n|        at divide (#1:2)\\n|        at (#2:1)\\n                             \\njshell> /list\\n                                                            \\n   1 : int divide(int x, int y) {\\n           return x / y;\\n       }\\n   2 : divide(5, 0)\\nChapter 2\\nExceptions\\n2-4\\nTab Completion for Snippets\\nWhen you enter snippets, use the Tab key to automatically complete the item.

Entries from the startup script aren\\'t listed unless\\nyou request them with the /list -start or /list -all command:\\njshell> /list -all\\n  s1 : import java.io. *;\\n  s2 : import java.math. *;\\n  s3 : import java.net. *;\\n3-1\\n  s4 : import java.nio.file. *;\\n  s5 : import java.util. *;\\n  s6 : import java.util.concurrent. *;\\n  s7 : import java.util.function. *;\\n  s8 : import java.util.prefs. *;\\n  s9 : import java.util.regex.', '*;\\n  s6 : import java.util.concurrent. *;\\n  s7 : import java.util.function. *;\\n  s8 : import java.util.prefs. *;\\n  s9 : import java.util.regex. *;\\n s10 : import java.util.stream. *;\\n   1 : System.out.println(\"Hi\");\\n   2 : int x = 45;\\n   3 : 2 + 2\\n   4 : String twice(String s) {\\n         return s + s;\\n       }\\n   5 : twice(\"Ocean\")\\nThe default startup script consists of several common imports. You can personalize your\\nstartup entries with the /set start command. For information about this command, enter /\\nhelp /set start. The /save -start command saves the current startup script as a starting\\npoint for your own startup script. Other important commands include /exit to leave JShell, /save to save your snippets, and /\\nopen to enter snippets from a file. Enter /help for a list of the JShell commands. Tab Completion for Commands\\nSimilar to snippet completion, when you enter commands and command options, use the Tab\\nkey to automatically complete the command or option. If the completion can’t be determined\\nfrom what was entered, then possible choices are provided. The following example shows the feedback when Tab is pressed after the leading slash (/) for\\ncommands:\\njshell> /<Tab>\\n/! /? /drop       /edit       /env        /exit       /help\\n/history    /imports    /list       /methods    /open       /reload     /\\nreset      \\n/save       /set        /types      /vars       \\n<press tab again to see synopsis>\\njshell> /\\nUnique completions are done in-place. For example, after you enter /l and press Tab, the line\\nis replaced with /list:\\njshell> /l<Tab>\\njshell> /list\\nChapter 3\\nTab Completion for Commands\\n3-2\\nTab completion also works for command options. The following example shows the use of the\\nTab key to display the options for the /list command:\\njshell> /list -<Tab>\\n-all       -history   -start     \\n<press tab again to see synopsis>\\njshell> /list -\\nNotice the message about pressing Tab again to show the command synopsis, which is a short\\ndescription of the command. Press Tab a third time to show the help documentation.', \"Press Tab a third time to show the help documentation. The\\nfollowing example shows the results of pressing Tab a second and third time:\\njshell> /list -<Tab>\\nlist the source you have typed\\n<press tab again to see full documentation>\\njshell> /list -<Tab>\\nShow the snippets, prefaced with their snippet IDs. /list\\n        List the currently active snippets of code that you typed or read \\nwith /open\\n/list -start\\n        List the evaluated startup snippets\\n/list -all\\n        List all snippets including failed, overwritten, dropped, and startup\\n/list <name>\\n        List snippets with the specified name (preference for active snippets)\\n/list <id>\\n        List the snippet with the specified snippet ID.

Commands, /set\\nsubcommands, command arguments, and command options can all be abbreviated, as long as\\nthe abbreviation is unique. The only command that begins with /l is /list, and the only /list option that begins with -a\\nis -all .\", 'The only command that begins with /l is /list, and the only /list option that begins with -a\\nis -all . Therefore, you can use the following abbreviations to enter the /list -all\\ncommand :\\njshell> /l -a\\nAlso, the only command that begins with /se is /set, the only /set subcommand that begins\\nwith fe is feedback, and the only feedback mode that begins with v is verbose, assuming no\\ncustom feedback modes that start with v exist. Therefore, you can use the following\\nabbreviations to set the feedback mode to verbose:\\njshell> /se fe v\\nNotice that /s isn’t a sufficient abbreviation because /save and /set both begin with the same\\nletter. When in doubt, you can use Tab completion to see the options. Chapter 3\\nCommand Abbreviations\\n3-4\\n4\\nEditing\\nJShell supports editing input at the jshell prompt and editing in an external editor of your\\nchoice. Shell editing enables you to edit snippets and commands as you enter them, and to retrieve\\nand change previously entered snippets and commands. An external editor provides an\\nalternative way to edit and create snippets, which is easier when you work with multiline\\nsnippets. Topics\\n•\\nShell Editing\\n•\\nExternal Editor\\nShell Editing\\nEditing input at the command prompt makes it easy to correct your input and to retrieve and\\nmodify previously entered commands and snippets. Shell editing in JShell is built on JLine2, which is functionally similar to BSD editline and\\nGNU readline in Emacs mode. See JLine2 user information and GNU Readline\\ndocumentation. Topics\\n•\\nInput Line Navigation\\n•\\nHistory Navigation\\n•\\nInput Line Modification\\n•\\nSearch and More\\nInput Line Navigation\\nShell editing is supported for editing the current line, or accessing the history through previous\\nsessions of JShell. For navigating the input line, the Ctrl key and Meta key are used in key combinations. If your\\nkeyboard doesn’t have a Meta key, then the Alt key is often mapped to provide Meta key\\nfunctionality. For basic navigation within a line, use the right and left arrow keys or Ctrl+B for backwards and\\nCtrl+F for forward. For navigation between lines in the history, use the up and down arrow\\nkeys. Pressing the up arrow once replaces the current line with the previous command or\\nsnippet line.', 'For navigation between lines in the history, use the up and down arrow\\nkeys. Pressing the up arrow once replaces the current line with the previous command or\\nsnippet line. Pressing the up arrow again brings you to the line previous to that. The history\\ncontains both commands and snippet lines. If a snippet has multiple lines, then the up and\\ndown arrows navigate through each line of a snippet. The following table identifies the keys used and the actions taken to navigate the input line. 4-1\\nKeys\\nAction\\nReturn\\nEnters the current line\\nLeft arrow\\nMoves backward one character\\nRight arrow\\nMoves forward one character\\nUp arrow\\nMoves up one line, backward through history\\nDown arrow\\nMoves down one line, forward through history\\nCtrl+A\\nMoves to the beginning of the line\\nCtrl+E\\nMoves to the end of the line\\nMeta+B\\nMoves backward one word\\nMeta+F\\nMoves forward one word\\nHistory Navigation\\nA history of snippets and commands is maintained across JShell sessions. This history\\nprovides you with access to items that you entered in the current and previous sessions. To reenter or edit prior input, navigate the history using the up, down, left, and right arrows. Entered text is inserted at the cursor. The Delete key is used to delete text. Press the Enter key\\nto reenter the history line, modified or not. The up and down arrow keys move backward and forward through the history one line at a\\ntime, for example:\\njshell> class C {\\n   ...>    int x;\\n   ...> }\\n|  created \\nclass                                                                         \\n                  \\njshell> /list\\n   1 : class C \\n         int x;\\n       }\\njshell> <up arrow>\\nThe up arrow key shows the following line:\\njshell> /list\\nPressing the up arrow again shows the last line of the class definition:\\njshell> }\\nPressing the down arrow returns to the /list command. Pressing Enter executes it:\\njshell> /list\\nChapter 4\\nShell Editing\\n4-2\\n   1 : class C {\\n         int x;\\n       }\\nCtrl+up arrow goes up by snippets. For single-line snippets, Ctrl+up arrow behaves the same\\nas up arrow. For multiline snippets, such as class C, Ctrl+up arrow skips the additional lines\\nand goes to the top of the snippet.', \"For single-line snippets, Ctrl+up arrow behaves the same\\nas up arrow. For multiline snippets, such as class C, Ctrl+up arrow skips the additional lines\\nand goes to the top of the snippet. Input Line Modification\\nInput lines retrieved from the history can be modified as needed and reentered, which saves\\nyou from having to retype a line just to make small changes. Add text at the current cursor position simply by entering it. See Input Line Navigation for the\\nkeys used move the cursor within a line. The following table identifies the keys used and the actions taken to modify the input line. Keys\\nAction\\nDelete\\nDeletes the character at or after the cursor, depending on the operating system. Backspace\\nDeletes the character before the cursor. Ctrl+K\\nDeletes the text from the cursor to the end of the line. Meta+D\\nDeletes the text from the cursor to the end of the word. Ctrl+W\\nDeletes the text from the cursor to the previous white space. Ctrl+Y\\nPastes the most recently deleted text into the line. Meta+Y\\nAfter Ctrl+Y, Meta+Y cycles through previously deleted text. Search and More\\nSearching the history is a feature of JShell that makes it easier to find the line you want without\\ngoing through the history one line at a time. To start your search, press Ctrl+R. At the prompt, enter the search string. The search proceeds\\nbackward from your most-recent entry and includes previous sessions of JShell. The following\\nexample shows the prompt that is presented after pressing Ctrl+R:\\njshell> <Ctrl+R>\\n((reverse-i-search)`': \\nBased on the example in History Navigation, entering class changes the display to show the\\nmost-recent line with the text class:\\n(reverse-i-search)`class': class C {\\nThe search is incremental, so this line is retrieved with just the first character c. You can\\ncontinue to search earlier in the history by pressing Ctrl+R repeatedly. Ctrl+S moves the\\nsearch forward towards the present. You can define a keyboard macro by entering Ctrl+x (, then entering your text, and finally\\nentering Ctrl+x ). To use your macro, enter Ctrl+x e.\\nChapter 4\\nShell Editing\\n4-3\\nThe following table shows the key combinations for searching and creating macros.\", 'To use your macro, enter Ctrl+x e.\\nChapter 4\\nShell Editing\\n4-3\\nThe following table shows the key combinations for searching and creating macros.

This editor can be\\nused to edit and create snippets, and is especially helpful for multiline snippets. You can\\nconfigure JShell to use the editor of your choice. To edit all existing snippets at once in an editor, use /edit without an option. To edit a specific\\nsnippet in an editor, use the /edit command with the snippet name or ID. Use the /list\\ncommand to get the snippet IDs. The following example opens an editor to edit the snippet\\nnamed volume, which was defined in Forward References:\\njshell> /edit volume\\nYou can also enter new snippets in the editor. When you save in the editor, any snippet that is\\nchanged or new is entered into the JShell session. Feedback from the snippets is shown in the\\nJShell window, however, no JShell prompt is shown. You can’t enter commands or snippets in\\nthe JShell window until the editor is closed. If you don’t specify an editor, then the following environment variables are checked in order:\\nJSHELLEDITOR, VISUAL, and EDITOR. If none of those are set, then a simple default editor is\\nused. To set up JShell to open the editor of your choice, use the /set editor command. The\\nargument to the /set editor command is the command needed to start the external editor\\nthat you want to use. The following example sets kwrite as the editor and opens the editor\\nwith all existing snippets:\\njshell> /set editor kwrite\\n|  Editor set to: kwrite\\njshell> /edit\\nDefining x in the external editor window and saving the change generates the following output\\nin the JShell window:\\n|  created variable x of type int with initial value 6\\nClosing the external editor restores the JShell prompt.', 'jshell> \\nChapter 4\\nExternal Editor\\n4-4\\n5\\nExternal Code\\nExternal classes are accessed from a JShell session through the class path. External modules\\nare accessed through the module path, additional modules setting, and module exports setting. Topics\\n•\\nSetting the Class Path\\n•\\nSetting Module Options\\nSetting the Class Path\\nYou can use external code that is accessible through the class path in your JShell session. Set the class path on the command line as shown in the following example:\\n % jshell --class-path myOwnClassPath\\nPoint your class path to directories or JAR files that have the packages that you want to\\naccess. The code must be compiled into class files. Code in the default package, which is also\\nknown as the unnamed package, can’t be accessed from JShell. After you set the class path,\\nthese packages can be imported into your session:\\njshell> import my.cool.code. *\\nYou can also use the /env command to set the class path, as shown in the following example:\\njshell> /env --class-path myOwnClassPath\\n|  Setting new options and restoring state. The /env command resets the execution state, reloading any current snippets with the new\\nclass path setting or other environment setting entered with the command. Setting Module Options\\nModules are supported in JShell. The module path can be set, additional modules to resolve\\nspecified, and module exports given. Module options can be provided in options to the /env command or on the command line as\\nshown in the following example:\\n % jshell --module-path myOwnModulePath  --add-modules my.module\\n5-1\\nTo see current environment settings, use /env without options.

Predefined modes with different levels of feedback are provided. Custom modes can be\\ncreated as needed.', 'Predefined modes with different levels of feedback are provided. Custom modes can be\\ncreated as needed. Topics\\n•\\nSetting the Feedback Mode\\n•\\nDefining a Feedback Mode\\nSetting the Feedback Mode\\nA feedback mode is a named user interaction configuration. A feedback mode defines the\\nprompts and feedback that are used in your interaction with JShell. Predefined modes are\\nprovided for your convenience. You can create custom modes as needed. The predefined modes can’t be modified, but they can be used as the base of a custom mode. The predefined modes, in descending order of verbosity are verbose, normal, concise, and\\nsilent.

However, if a\\ncommand is entered or the snippet results in an error, then the value that users enter at the\\nprompt might not be assigned that ID. All settings have a duration of the current session; they are not reset by the /reset command. If you want the settings to be the default for future sessions, then use the -retain option to\\nkeep them.

Scripts can be a local file, or one of the following predefined scripts:\\nScript Name\\nScript Contents\\nDEFAULT\\nIncludes commonly needed import declarations. This script is used if no other\\nstartup script is provided. JAVASE\\nImports the core Java SE API defined by the java.se module, which causes\\na noticeable delay in starting JShell due to the number of packages. PRINTING\\nDefines JShell methods that redirect to the print, println, and printf\\nmethods in PrintStream.

Topics\\n•\\nStartup Scripts\\n•\\nCreating and Loading Scripts\\n•\\nAccessing Command Line Tools Through JShell\\nStartup Scripts\\nStartup scripts contain snippets and commands that are loaded when a JShell session is\\nstarted. The default startup script contains common import statements. You can create custom\\nscripts as needed. Startup scripts are loaded each time the jshell tool is reset. Reset occurs during the initial\\nstartup and with the /reset, /reload, and /env commands. If you do not set the script, then,\\nthe default startup script, DEFAULT, is used. This default script defines commonly needed import\\ndeclarations. Note:\\nThe Java language defines that the java.lang package is automatically imported\\nso this package doesn’t need to be explicitly imported.', 'This default script defines commonly needed import\\ndeclarations. Note:\\nThe Java language defines that the java.lang package is automatically imported\\nso this package doesn’t need to be explicitly imported. To set the startup script, use the /set start command:\\njshell> /set start mystartup.jsh\\njshell> /reset\\n|  Resetting state. 7-1\\nAs with all /set commands, the duration of the setting is the current session unless the -\\nretain option is used. Typically, the -retain option isn’t used when you test a startup script\\nsetting. When the desired setting is found, use the-retain option to preserve it:\\njshell> /set start -retain\\nThe startup script is then loaded the next time you start the jshell tool. Remember that the startup scripts are loaded into the current session only when the state is\\nreset. The contents of the script is stored, not a reference to the script. The script is read only\\nat the time the /set start command is run. However, predefined scripts are loaded by\\nreference and can be updated with new releases of the JDK. Startup scripts can also be specified with the --startup command-line flag:\\n% jshell --startup mystartup.jsh\\nFor experimentation, it is useful to have print methods that don\\'t need the System.out. prefix. Use the predefined PRINTING script to access the print, println, and printf methods. You can specify more than one startup script with /set start. The following example sets the\\nstartup to load both the default imports and printing definitions:\\njshell> /set start -retain DEFAULT PRINTING\\njshell> /exit\\n|  Goodbye\\n% jshell\\n|  Welcome to JShell -- Version 9\\n|  For an introduction type: /help intro\\njshell> println(\"Hello World!\") Hello World!

UCL COMPUTER SCIENCE\\nThe Array Data Structure (Reminder)\\n• An array is a data structure. • A data structure is a collection of values, organised\\nin a particular way. •\\nArray Properties:\\n• An array is a sequence of values. • A Sequence data structure. • Can be accessed in sequentially. • Start at the first value and work through each value \\nin turn, giving O(n) performance. • Or randomly access any element as needed. • Random Access with O(1) performance. • This is what makes arrays most useful. 3\\n© UCL CS 2025.

C\\n• Actually, we’ve covered most of this before! • Java uses square bracket syntax for arrays, \\nand using Java arrays looks very similar to \\nusing C arrays. • Arrays are still fixed size, holding values of one \\ntype. • BUT there are no pointers in Java, though! • Arrays can be accessed only using square \\nbracket syntax. • No pointer arithmetic. • No dereference (‘*’) or address-of (‘&’) operators. 4\\n© UCL CS 2025.

Fourth Itera*on \\nRequirements should be sorted priori(sed lists. Must Have requirements are essen(al and \\nthe system cannot func(on if any are missing. These should be delivered in the ﬁrst release \\nitera(on. Should Have requirements are important and need to be part of the system but \\ncan be delivered in the next release itera(on. A release itera(on is a working version of the \\nsoLware that is delivered, or made available, to users. For a basic func(onal system in the ﬁrst release itera(on, the Must Have requirements \\nwould include the core func(onali(es that allow the system to perform its primary tasks of \\nmanaging customers, orders, and products. Here is a priori(zed list: \\n \\nMust Have (First Release Itera(on): \\n \\nR1 \\nR2 \\nR3 \\nR4 \\nR5 \\nR6 \\nR9 \\nR10 \\nR11 \\nR12 \\nR14 \\nR15 \\nR16 \\nR17 \\nR19 \\nR20 \\nR21 \\nR24 \\n \\nShould Have (Second Release Itera(on): \\nR7 \\nR8 \\nR18 \\nR22 \\nR23 \\n \\n- 5 - \\nRequirements such as upda(ng customer/product details or genera(ng reports (R7, R8, R22, \\nR23) are important but not essen(al for the system to fulﬁl its primary purpose and can thus \\nbe scheduled for the second itera(on. Deac(va(ng customers instead of dele(ng (R18) is \\nalso a reﬁnement that can follow once the basic func(onality is assured. These are Could \\nHave or Won’t Have requirements. The MoSCoW Method \\nThis approach to requirements is known as the MoSCoW method, a priori(za(on technique \\nused extensively in project management and soLware development to categorize \\nrequirements into four dis(nct groups: Must have, Should have, Could have, and Won't \\nhave. This method aids in reaching a consensus among stakeholders on the delivery order of \\neach requirement based on its importance.\", 'This method aids in reaching a consensus among stakeholders on the delivery order of \\neach requirement based on its importance. The \"Must have\" requirements are essen(al to the project\\'s current phase and are \\nconsidered non-nego(able for the project to succeed. \"Should have\" requirements are \\nimportant but not cri(cal for the current phase; these can be postponed to future phases \\nwithout signiﬁcant impact on the current delivery. \"Could have\" requirements are desirable \\nbut less important, and are oLen the ﬁrst to be removed if (me or resources become \\nconstrained. Lastly, \"Won\\'t have\" requirements are those that have been agreed upon as the \\nleast cri(cal or not appropriate at the current (me and are not scheduled for the current \\nphase of delivery.

Check the Third Itera(on requirements. a. Can you understand them? b. Are any requirements too vague or open to diﬀerent interpreta(ons by \\ndiﬀerent people? c. Is the level of detail consistent across the requirements (e.g., any over or \\nunder detailed compared to others)? d. Is any func(onality missing or not needed? e. Should any requirements be split into two requirements? 2. Is the list of Must Have requirements complete? Would implemen(ng them result in \\na working system? 3. How do you know when the requirements are complete?', \"-1- \\n \\nAn Example Linked List Implementation \\nThis example shows how a linked list class can be implemented using a chain of list element \\nobjects to represent a list. A basic set of list operations is provided as well as two example \\niterators. This code is for showing implementation techniques and should not be taken as a \\ncomplete, robust list class implementation (see the LinkedList class in the standard Java Class \\nLibraries instead). The class implements 'Lisp Style' head and tail methods (car and cdr in Lisp), allowing the value at \\nthe head of a list to be returned or a shallow copy of the tail of a list (all values expect the one at \\nthe head of the list). It is also possible to insert a value at the head of a list (cons). The classes and interfaces are: \\n• interface InsertIterator<E> \\n• interface InsertIterable<E> \\n• interface SimpleList<E> \\n• class LinkedList<E> \\n• class LinkedListTest (JUnit 5 Test class) \\nThis UML class diagram shows the relationship of the classes and interfaces to each other. The cross in a circle notation on the associations represents the nesting, or containment, \\nrelationship. The icons with a circle in the top right hand corner are for interfaces. The Iterator and \\nIterable interfaces declared within the standard Java class libraries are shown, with the Iterator and \\nIterable icons in light grey indicating they are not part of the code listed below. Note that ListElement, LinkedListIterator and LinkedListInsertIterator are all declared as nested \\nclasses inside LinkedList. ListElement is a static class, only accessible within the scope of class \\nLinkedList but it does not have access to anything in that scope. The other two classes are inner or \\nmember classes, not declared using static, and do have access to the scope of class LinkedList. This is a subtle but important distinction. Linked List Example \\n-2- \\nLinkedList Source Code \\nBelow is the complete source code of the LinkedList implementation. Each class, unless nested, or \\ninterface should be saved to a separate file. As noted earlier, this code illustrates a number of \\ndesign and coding concepts, rather than provide a practical implementation of a list that you might \\nuse in production code. The class does work, however, and the test code can be used to confirm \\nthis. The code is commented with documentation comments, which can be processed to produce the \\nJavadoc style documentation pages like those of the standard library classes.\", 'The class does work, however, and the test code can be used to confirm \\nthis.

Introduction \\nThese notes provide information about getting started with Java, introduce some Java concepts, \\nand gives some example code. The notes are meant to aid your transition to Java from C but are \\nnot intended to be a replacement for a textbook. You should find a Java textbook you like, there \\nare many to choose from, and systematically reading through it. The Java language style of syntax is derived from C via the language C++, so Java source code \\nwill look familiar and, other than pointer syntax, uses much the same core set of syntactic \\nelements. However, Java is an object-oriented programming language, so there are some \\nimportant basic differences in the way that programs are designed and written, along with a lot of \\nnew syntax that needs to be learnt. Further, Java is a much larger and more complex language \\nthan C and it will take time to learn about it. Java programs are organised as a collection of classes. A class declares a combination of \\nvariables and methods that define the behaviour of an object of the class, referred to as an \\ninstance object (as in an ‘instance of’ the class). Compared to C the label ‘method’ is used instead \\nof ‘function’ and C does not support classes at all. A C program is just a collection of functions, \\nwhile a Java program is a collection of classes, each of which define methods. Classes provide an \\nimportant structuring mechanism that not only aids the design and implementation of programs, \\nespecially larger programs, but also changes the way we think about design and programming. An object is an entity that is created when a program is run. It holds a collection of instance \\nvariables, as specified by its class, and the methods declared by its class can be called on the \\nobject and have access to the object’s variables. When an object-oriented program is run many \\nobjects can be created and they call each other’s methods to carry out the required behaviour. While this introduction focusses on the Java language, the Java Platform comes with very \\nextensive class library code that provides a huge range of functionality (many thousands of \\nclasses). The Java language cannot be separated from the class libraries, so you always use both \\nthe language and library. This makes Java a much larger and more complex programming platform \\nthan C. \\n2.', 'The Java language cannot be separated from the class libraries, so you always use both \\nthe language and library. This makes Java a much larger and more complex programming platform \\nthan C. \\n2. The Java Development Kit (JDK) \\nJava was originally developed by a company called Sun Microsystems, which was taken over by \\nOracle (the database company). Oracle is now the maintainer and developer of Java and has \\nextensive online resources at: https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/. To program with Java you need a version of the Java Development Kit or JDK. Oracle provides the \\nofficial version, which is freely available, but there is also the open source OpenJDK for those who \\nwant a more independent version of Java (http://openjdk.java.net), plus other open-source \\nimplementations in various stages of development. The JDK provides a full implementation of Java along with the core set of tools to compile and run \\nJava programs. The current release version of Oracle Java is Java SE 23 (SE stands for Standard \\nEdition), and this is the preferred version you should use for this module. Oracle has a regular \\nrelease cycle for Java, with a new version being released every six months, and the next version is \\nJava 24 due in March. Java 21 is the current long-term support (LTS) version of Java, and this \\nversion will be supported for a much longer time than other current versions. UCL COMPUTER SCIENCE \\nJava Quick Introduction \\n-2- \\nLab machines may be running an older version of Java, which will be sufficient for this module, \\nalthough some of the latest features mentioned in lectures won’t be available. Java 11 and later have some very significant differences and extensions, and the newer versions \\nof Java have taken over as the default that most developers should use for new development. Java 17 and later have further important additions, and new development should not be started \\nwith any earlier versions. A fair amount of production code (e.g., code running cloud services) is still using Java SE 8 as it \\nhas been very well supported, and for some time had the best overall compatibility with the huge \\nrange of development tools and cloud systems in general use. However, Oracle no longer provides \\nfree support for it and discourages any new development with this version. As Java 8 is missing \\nmany features now in Java 21 you should not use it for this module.', 'However, Oracle no longer provides \\nfree support for it and discourages any new development with this version. As Java 8 is missing \\nmany features now in Java 21 you should not use it for this module. Be careful that you don’t install \\nit by mistake. 2.1. Installing the JDK \\nTo program with Java on your own computer you need to have the JDK installed. You can easily \\ndownload and install the latest Java 23 Oracle JDK for your own computer. It is freely available at \\nno cost, although you may have to sign up for a free Oracle account. Or you can use OpenJDK 23 \\nif you want to use a fully Open Source version1. However, before you rush off and install Java by downloading the JDK separately, an alternative \\nway of getting Java is via the Integrated Development Environment (IDE). This module will be \\nusing the IntelliJ IDEA IDE by default, which is simply by far the best Java development \\nenvironment. The IDE can download versions of Java as you need them, so you don’t have to \\nmanually do the install. In case you do want to install a Java JDK separately, then if you are using macOS, Windows or \\nLinux then you can download the Java Platform, Standard Edition JDK from \\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html or the equivalent OpenJDK \\nfrom https://openjdk.java.net. Make sure you do install the JDK and not the JRE (Java Runtime \\nEdition), as the JRE doesn’t include the required programming tools. Linux users may be able to use their package management tool (such as apt, rpm or yum) to install \\nthe JDK. The details vary depending on which version of Linux you have. You may find your \\nversion of Linux already has the OpenJDK or another open source JDK installed, or specifies a \\ndefault Java to install. Check, however, what version of Java is or will be installed, as it may not be \\nJava 23, and if that is the case you will need to find the install instructions for Java 23 for your \\nversion of Linux. For example, if you use Ubuntu Linux then follow the instructions here: \\nhttps://ubuntuhandbook.org/?s=jdk+23 on how to install Oracle Java 23. A JDK will receive periodic bug fixes and on most machines you will automatically be prompted to \\nupdate to the latest version when it becomes available.', 'A JDK will receive periodic bug fixes and on most machines you will automatically be prompted to \\nupdate to the latest version when it becomes available. Bug fixes often address security issues so \\nkeep up to date with the latest version of the JDK you are using. On any machine you can find out which version of Java is installed as the default version by \\nopening a terminal window and typing the command: \\njava -version \\nThis will display something like this, depending on which specific version you have: \\njava version \"23\" 2024-09-17 \\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 23+37-2369) \\n \\n1 Actually, just to confuse everything, OpenJDK is now managed by Oracle as well. If you want a completely \\nnon-Oracle JDK then search for some of the other open-source projects. Java Quick Introduction \\n-3- \\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 23+37-2369, mixed mode, \\nsharing) \\nYou can see that the version is given as 23 with a release date and the build number. If you install \\nthe JDK via the IDEA IDE you should use the terminal inside the IDE. Java SE stands for Java Standard Edition, which these days is the edition that everyone uses as \\ntheir core Java platform. There used to be Java EE or Enterprise Edition, which was developed for \\nweb and cloud application development but is no longer being developed by Oracle. In 2017 \\nOracle donated Java EE to the Eclipse Foundation as an open-source project, and it is now known \\nas Jakarta EE. 2.2. Java Documentation \\nA great deal of information about Java is available online (make use of it!). One very important \\nresource is the standard Java SE documentation. The Java 23 documentation is available here: \\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/23/. In addition, you will make a lot of use of the Java class \\nlibrary documentation, often referred to as the ‘Javadoc’, at: \\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/23/docs/api/index.html. Bookmark both these locations and \\nspend some time browsing through the documentation. Java comes with extensive code libraries, \\ncalled the class libraries, and you will need to become familiar with various parts of the libraries \\n(but not all of them!).', 'Bookmark both these locations and \\nspend some time browsing through the documentation. Java comes with extensive code libraries, \\ncalled the class libraries, and you will need to become familiar with various parts of the libraries \\n(but not all of them!). If you need to see the same documentation for earlier versions of Java \\nsubstitute the 23 in the URLs for the version you want. There is a great deal of other documentation and tutorials available, and it can appear daunting \\nwhen you first see it. Don’t let it intimidate you! There will be a lot of unfamiliar jargon and ideas but \\nover time it will make sense. Just don’t give up until it does! You do need to make sure you are \\nlooking at up to date information about Java 17 or later, so check your source carefully and be \\ncareful of anything more than about three years old. Another useful place to browse is the online Java Tutorials at \\nhttp://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/. This provides an introduction to the core Java language as \\nwell as tutorials on some more advanced features. It was written for Java 8, making it well out of \\ndate based on the previous comments about Java versions, but is good enough to give you an \\nintroduction to the core Java language and library classes, which is still valid for current Java \\nversions. Most Java 8 code should compile and run with Java 17 or higher. 3. One-class Programs \\nTo get started with Java you will initially work with ‘one-class’ Java programs that have this \\nstructure: \\nclass MyClass  \\n{  \\n  // Declare a method. public void doSomething() \\n  { \\n    // Your statements go here. \\n  } // Other methods added here. // The main method is called first to start the program \\n  public static void main(String[] args)  \\n  {  \\n    // Create an object of the class. ClassName name = new ClassName(); \\n    // Call a method on the object. name.doSomething(); \\nJava Quick Introduction \\n-4- \\n  } \\n} \\nThis is how a Java class is declared. The class name follows the class keyword at the start, so \\nthis class is called MyClass. It must be saved into a file called MyClass.java. All source files are \\nnamed after the class they contain and the .java extension must be used.', 'The class name follows the class keyword at the start, so \\nthis class is called MyClass. It must be saved into a file called MyClass.java. All source files are \\nnamed after the class they contain and the .java extension must be used. The file name must \\nmatch the class name exactly, with the same upper and lower case letters. A one-class program consists of a single class in one source file but normally Java programs will \\nconsist of many classes and many source files. The one-class label refers to the code you actually \\nwrite, as any Java program will depend on lots of other JDK classes to compile and run. The classes you write as you get started with Java should each go into a separate .java source file, \\nso don’t be tempted to put all your classes in the same file as this will result in a lot of problems \\ntrying to compile and run code. The lines of source code shown above represent the basic infrastructure that should be included in \\nany one-class program used in this module for it to be syntactically correct. Initially you will have to \\ntake this for granted and simply type the code in! As the module progresses, the true purpose and \\nmeaning of all the parts will be explained. At this point think of the class being a bit like a C \\nlanguage source file containing a collection of functions to run, wrapped up in a class scope rather \\nthan a file scope. The comments in bold (\"Your statements go here\") show where you type in the source code \\nspecific to your program. A typical class will have a number of methods, which you add as \\nrequired. Remember that the label ‘method’ is used instead of function used with languages such \\nas C and Haskell. Don’t try and put all your code into a single method - a well-designed method is \\nshort and cohesive, like a well-designed function. You can also see that the outline class has a method called main, which is the first method called \\nautomatically when the program is run. 3.1.', 'You can also see that the outline class has a method called main, which is the first method called \\nautomatically when the program is run. 3.1. Hello World \\nUsing the template above, a basic ‘Hello World’ program would be: \\nclass HelloWorld  \\n{  \\n  public void sayHello() \\n  { \\n    System.out.println(“Hello World”); \\n  } \\n \\n  public static void main(String[] args)  \\n  {  \\n    HelloWorld hello = new HelloWorld(); \\n    hello.sayHello(); \\n  } \\n} \\nThis is not actually the shortest version that could be written, instead it illustrates the idea of \\ncreating an object using the new keyword and then calling a method on the object. This basic \\npattern will be followed for most of the programs and exercises in the first part of the module. When run the program starts at the main method, which creates a HelloWorld object and then \\ncalls the sayHello method on the object. This is like a C program being run as a sequence of \\nfunction calls, but we now have an object and the idea that methods can be called on an object, \\nrather than just being called like a C function. The main method is different in that it doesn’t need \\nto be called on an object, as there is no object to call it on yet right at the start of the program. Java Quick Introduction \\n-5- \\nIn passing, if a HelloWorld object is not created, then a shorter version would be: \\nclass HelloWorld  \\n{  \\n  public static void main(String[] args)  \\n  {  \\n    System.out.println(“Hello World”); \\n  } \\n} \\nA class is still declared but no HelloWorld object is created. Just the main method is called, \\nwhich doesn’t need to be called on an object. It does use an object to do the printing (the thing \\nnamed by System.out), but that object is created automatically rather than explicitly using the new \\nkeyword. This is not actually the shortest version of Hello World you could write in Java, as Java 23 has a \\nmechanism called ‘instance main methods’ that allow a main method to be written without being \\ndeclared in a class. Of course, you might compare this to Python, which would give a one-line program: \\nprint(“Hello World”) \\nJava syntax is typically more verbose that Python syntax! 4.', \"Of course, you might compare this to Python, which would give a one-line program: \\nprint(“Hello World”) \\nJava syntax is typically more verbose that Python syntax! 4. Editing and Compiling \\nSource code is typed into the computer using an editor and then saved to a file. As already noted, \\nthe best IDE is IntelliJ IDEA (https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/). By default this is a paid-for \\ncommercial tool, called the Ultimate edition, but there is an excellent free open source Community \\nEdition that is more than good enough for this module. Even better, as a student you can apply for \\na free one-year copy of the full Ultimate version of IDEA (see https://www.jetbrains.com/student/). You will need to spend some time familiarising yourself with the IDE and practice using it. IntelliJ \\nIDEA is a professional quality tool that implements many ideas and concepts Java programmers \\nare expected to be familiar with. At first sight it will appear complex but don’t be put off or \\nintimidated by this! You can carry on using Visual Studio Code, which supports Java well if you install the Extension \\nPack for Java extension. However, all the examples and coding in this module will be using Intellij \\nIDEA, and you should definitely be proficient in using it for Java development. Some of the later \\nexamples and coursework will be much better supported by IDEA. Don’t be tempted to use a basic text editor like NotePad on Windows, or TextEdit on macOS, as a program \\neditor. While Java source code is just text, using an ordinary text editor (or even worse an application like \\nWord) to edit the code is inefficient and will end up causing lots of problems. IDE editors like the one in \\nIntelliJ IDEA understand Java syntax and provide many useful facilities for working with code. Although you will be using an IDE, a program can be compiled from a command line shell running \\nin a terminal window using the javac command (java compile): \\n javac ClassName.java \\nand run using the java command: \\n java ClassName \\nWhen the compilation is successful a .class file is created and will appear in your directory (for \\nexample, ClassName.class). .class files contain the code required to run your program so don't delete them!\", '.class files contain the code required to run your program so don\\'t delete them! Java Quick Introduction \\n-6- \\nIn the example class shown earlier, the class name HelloWorld is effectively the name of the \\nprogram and, as noted, the source code should be saved to the file HelloWorld.java. When \\nyou write your own programs you should substitute a different class name for each program (so, \\ndon\\'t call every one HelloWorld, it is just an example name!). The name should try to describe \\nwhat the program does. It should also start with a capital letter and not include any spaces or \\npunctuation marks. All Java programmers follow the convention of class names starting with a \\ncapital letter even if the language does not require it. 5. Another Example Class \\nAll Java programs must consist of at least one class and all methods and other code are declared \\nwithin a class. You cannot have file-scope (global) variables like you have in C, or any code \\ndeclared outside a class.2 \\nTry typing in the following Java class, compiling it and then running it as a program. // Written by <your name and date> \\n// This program displays some useful information. class MyProgram  \\n{  \\n  public void displayMessage() \\n  { \\n    System.out.println(\"This is my first Java program\"); \\n    System.out.println(\"It WORKS!! \"); \\n  } \\n \\n  public static void main(String[] args)  \\n  {  \\n    // Create an object and tell it to do something \\n    MyProgram program = new MyProgram(); \\n    program.displayMessage(); \\n  } \\n} \\n \\nIt can be useful to start the source code with two lines of comments, the first stating who wrote the \\nprogram and the date, the second giving a brief explanation of what the program does: \\n// Written by A. Person 01/01/23 \\n// This program displays some useful information. class ClassName  \\n{  \\netc. A line containing System.out.println is referred to as an output statement and is used to \\ndisplay text on the computer screen. Again you will have to take as given the structure of an output \\nstatement but you can edit the text between the double quotes to output anything you like.', \"Again you will have to take as given the structure of an output \\nstatement but you can edit the text between the double quotes to output anything you like. Also \\nnote the use of semi-colons, which are used to mark the end of statements (the statement \\nterminator symbol) and must be present for the code to compile without error (this is just like C). You can also use System.out.printf, which is similar to the C printf function. 2 Actually this is not strictly true as you can declare variables and methods in interfaces, enums and records, \\nbut these are more advanced topics (and all are actually kinds of classes). Further Java 21 introduced \\nseveral features that change this as well. However, when compiling and running code, everything is treated \\nas being in a class even if you don’t see the class! Java Quick Introduction \\n-7- \\nDon't forget, the program must be saved in a file called MyProgram.java. Once you have got the program working try editing it to deliberately introduce errors. For example, \\nremove a semi-colon, delete a bracket or change the spelling of one of the words making up the \\nprogram. Observe the error messages you get when you try to compile the modified program. At \\nfirst they may not make too much sense but will become familiar! Learn what each error message \\nmeans and how to resolve the problem reported. Also note that when you are editing the source \\ncode in an IDE like IDEA the IDE is continuously analysing the code and will typically spot errors \\nas soon as you make them without having to compile the code. The code where the error is \\nlocated gets highlighted and suggestions made on how to fix the error. As we have already seen, in a similar way to a C program requiring a function called main, the \\nmethod called main in a one-class program is the first method called when the program is run. In \\nclass MyProgram the main method creates a new MyProgram object and then calls the \\ndisplayMessage method on that object. The main method could be shortened to this, avoiding \\nthe need for a local variable: \\n public static void main(String[] args)  \\n  {  \\n    // Create an object and tell it to do something \\n    new MyProgram().displayMessage(); \\n  } \\nThe MyProgram example has been deliberately written to emphasise that proper use of Java \\nrequires objects to be created and then methods called on the objects.\", 'For note, however, the \\nprogram could be reduced to this: \\nclass MyProgram  \\n{  \\n  public static void main(String[] args)  \\n  {  \\n    System.out.println(\"This is my first Java program\"); \\n    System.out.println(\"It WORKS!! \"); \\n  } \\n} \\nHere the class contains the main method only and doesn’t create a MyProgram object. Ignoring \\nthe additions made to Java 21, this is the closest equivalent to a C program that consists of just a \\nmain function that prints out a message. The Java main method must be declared inside a class, \\nhowever, and cannot be compiled otherwise. In general, you don’t write Java programs consisting of just a main method, other than for \\nexperimenting or possibly for short utility programs. Think of these as degenerate Java programs \\nto be used only in specific cases. However, another recent addition to Java is the ability to run one-class programs directly, without \\nhaving to use javac to compile them first. Using the program above, MyProgram, you can run it \\nusing just the java command: \\n java ClassName \\nThe java command starts the Java Virtual Machine, which is what actually runs the program. For \\nsimple one-class programs it will actually invoke the compiler itself before running the code. Hence, the code is still compiled, it always is, but you don’t have to use javac yourself. The Java Virtual Machine, or JVM, is the program that runs your Java programs. It handles many \\nthings including memory management, so that the Java programmer never sees or controls how \\nthese details work. This leads to much safer code, as the kind of memory allocation and access \\nerrors that a C programmer can make can’t happen to a Java programmer. Java Quick Introduction \\n-8- \\nEven more interesting is that a core component of the JVM is the Just In Time compiler (the JIT), \\nwhich is constantly modifying and optimising code as it is being run, effectively recompiling \\nsections of the code depending on what the program is currently doing. With C the compiled code \\nis static and never changes at runtime, with Java the code is dynamic, continually being analysed \\nand modified. This means that Java code can be very fast and efficient at runtime, adapting to \\nwhat is actually happening at any given time. 6.', \"This means that Java code can be very fast and efficient at runtime, adapting to \\nwhat is actually happening at any given time. 6. Program Source Code Presentation \\nRegardless of whether you are using C, Java, Haskell, Python or any other programming \\nlanguage, the source code of a program should always be presented neatly and made as readable \\nas possible. Program code is primarily read by people (you!) so make sure it communicates \\neffectively: \\n• Don't attempt to cram everything into the minimum amount of space. It doesn't make any \\ndifference to the speed of the program when it is run! • Use blank space and empty lines to layout the program source code neatly. • Use indentation to reflect the structure of the program (look at the example code). • Line up the start of lines and opening/closing braces. • Include the comments at the start of the code to identify what the program is. Use further \\ncomments only if more explanation is needed elsewhere in the program that cannot be provided \\nby good readable code. Don't use comments to state what is obvious from reading the code. • Be consistent, so that all your source code is formatted following the same layout. Another great feature of an IDE is that you can specify the source code formatting rules and the \\nIDE will apply them automatically or reformat code that doesn’t match the specified rules. The \\nIntelliJ IDE supports this very well. This means that there is no excuse for poorly formatted source \\ncode! 7. Declaration v. Definition \\nYou hopefully remember that in C there is an important distinction between a declaration and a \\ndefinition. A declaration names a variable or function and its type only, while a definition \\nadditionally allocates memory for a variable or gives the complete function body. A complete \\nprogram requires a definition for everything, while compiling a single source file can use just \\ndeclarations as needed. If in any doubt about the differences go back and review what you learnt \\nabout C. \\nJava has the same concept but in a more sophisticated way and a lot of the time we don’t have to \\nworry that much about the difference between declaration and definition. For example, in the same \\nclass Java doesn’t require a method (function) to be declared before it is called in a method. Java \\nprogrammers tend to just say that a variable or method has been declared without needing to be \\nmore precise. 8.\", 'Java \\nprogrammers tend to just say that a variable or method has been declared without needing to be \\nmore precise. 8. Variables \\nVariables allow values to be stored and manipulated. Variables must be declared and initialised \\nbefore being used: \\nint x = 0; \\ndouble b = 1.234; \\nA variable declaration must include a type, while the variable name should reflect the use of the \\nvariable (so one letter variable names such as those above are not ideal!). Having written that, \\nloop counter variables are often given a single character name. A variable name must start with a \\nletter (a-z), followed by any combination of letters and numbers. Punctuation symbols, expect for \\nunderscore, are not allowed, and there cannot be spaces in a name. By convention, variable \\nnames should start with a lowercase letter. Java Quick Introduction \\n-9- \\nJava has much the same set of basic types and arithmetic operators as C, and the syntax \\nof expressions will look very familiar. The similarities go as far as incrementing integer \\nvariables (type int) using the operator ++ and decrementing using --. For example: \\nx++ ; // increment x \\ny-- ; // decrement y \\nAlso: \\nx += 1 ; // increment x \\ny -= 1 ; // decrement y \\n9. Booleans \\nJava has a proper type boolean with the literal values true and false. A boolean variable can \\nbe declared and initialised with a statement like: \\nboolean b = true; // true and false and Java keywords \\nBoolean expressions are created using relational and boolean operators. Relational operators are \\nused to compare values such as integers: \\nless than \\ngreater than \\nequal to \\nless than or equal to \\ngreater than or equal to \\na < b \\na > b \\na == b \\na <= b \\na >= b \\n \\nBoolean operators combine boolean expressions: \\nand \\nor \\nnegation (not) \\na && b \\na || b \\n!a \\n \\nOperators can be combined to create more complex boolean expressions: \\n a < 0 && b > 2 \\nbut you need to make sure that the operators are evaluated in the order you expect. If in any doubt \\nbracket the sub-expressions: \\n(a < 0) && (b > 2) \\n10.', 'If in any doubt \\nbracket the sub-expressions: \\n(a < 0) && (b > 2) \\n10. If statement \\nSelection is provided by the if statement: \\nif (boolean-exp) \\n{ \\n  // Statements executed if boolean-exp is true \\n} \\nThis allows the conditional execution of a statement sequence. A variation is the if-else statement: \\nif (boolean-exp) \\n{  \\n  // Statements executed if boolean-exp is true  \\n} \\nelse \\nJava Quick Introduction \\n-10- \\n{ \\n  // Statements executed if boolean-exp is false \\n} \\nThis allows a choice between two different statement sequences. 11. Java Loops \\nJava has three kinds of loop: \\na) The while loop \\nwhile (boolean-exp) \\n{ \\n  // Loop body \\n} \\nThe loop body can be executed zero or more times. \"boolean-exp\" means an expression that \\nevaluates to a boolean value (true or false). When you write a loop you provide a boolean \\nexpression appropriate to the loop you are trying to write. b) The do-while loop \\ndo \\n{ \\n  // Loop body \\n} while (boolean-exp); \\nThe loop body can be executed one or more times. Do loops are used relatively infrequently but do \\nprovide a neater solution in situations where the statements in the loop body have to be evaluated \\nat least once. c) The for-loop \\nJava has two kinds of for-loop. The standard for-loop, which is described here, and the enhanced \\nfor-loop that will be introduced later in these notes. for (init-exp ; test-exp ; exp) \\n{ \\n  // Loop body \\n} \\nThe standard for-loop is just like the C version! For loops are typically used for counting. The loop \\nbody can be evaluated zero or more times. \"init-exp\" is an expression evaluated before the loop \\nbody is first evaluated and usually initialises a counter variable. \"test-exp\" is a boolean expression \\nthat is used to decide whether the loop body should be evaluated. If \"test-exp\" is true the body is \\nevaluated, otherwise the loop terminates. \"test-exp\" is evaluated before the start of every \\nevaluation of the loop body, not just once. \"exp\" is an expression evaluated after the loop body has \\nbeen evaluated but before \"test-exp\" is evaluated again.', '\"test-exp\" is evaluated before the start of every \\nevaluation of the loop body, not just once. \"exp\" is an expression evaluated after the loop body has \\nbeen evaluated but before \"test-exp\" is evaluated again. \"exp\" is used to increment the loop \\ncounter. Java allows a for loop variable to be declared in the for loop as below, and this is the most \\ncommon way of declaring loop variables. Newer versions of C support this as well, but depending \\non which version of gcc you were using it may not have been supported. for (int x = 1 ; x < 10 ; x++) \\n{ \\n  // Loop body \\n} \\nThe other kind of for loop is sometimes referred to as the enhanced for loop: \\nfor (int n : array) \\nJava Quick Introduction \\n-11- \\n{ \\n  // Loop body \\n} \\nIn this example, the variable array is actually an array of ints. The for loop initialises the variable \\nn to each int value in the array in turn as the loop iterates, and n can be used in the loop body. There is no loop counter variable, the loop body just gets each value in the array. You will see a bit later that Java supports the same basic square bracket syntax as C for array \\nindexing but there is no concept of pointers, and code cannot access an invalid array element \\noutside the bounds of the array. If code tries to do that a runtime error called an exception is \\ntriggered and, by default, the program will terminate. The while, do and for loops have a body, bracketed by braces (curly brackets) — make sure you \\nalways include the braces. Loop bodies can contain any statement sequence, including nested \\nloops. A loop body is actually a compound statement. Loops should have a properly determined termination condition. This often means that one or more \\nstatements in the loop body should have some effect on the boolean expression controlling the \\nloop execution. In particular, the expression should evaluate to false within a reasonable number of \\nevaluations of the loop body. 12. Loop Examples \\nThe following examples show how the Java syntax works, and to illustrate the kinds of programs \\nyou should be writing.

Arrays \\nBy now you might be thinking that Java looks pretty much like C, except for a few extra keywords \\nand the class thing. Well, yes, the basic Java syntax is derived directly from C, and this was a \\ndeliberate design decision by the designers of Java so that the language would be familiar to \\nexisting programmers and they would be more likely to start using it. And it worked! However, with the basic syntax out the way we start to see more and more differences, and that \\nJava is a lot more advanced language than C. For a start there are no pointers, but there is still the \\nsquare bracket syntax for arrays. The syntax for declaring, creating and using arrays will be covered in more detail in the lectures.', \"The syntax for declaring, creating and using arrays will be covered in more detail in the lectures. In \\nsummary, an array is created as follows: \\nint[] myArray = new int[10]; // An array of 10 ints \\nAn array variable (myArray in the example above, note the position of the square brackets), must \\nbe explicitly initialised to reference a new array object, created with a new expression. A common \\nmistake is to forget to create the array, so always check for this if a program does not compile or \\nwork. Array indexing, the operation used to access array elements, is done using the square bracket \\nnotation: \\nmyArray[x] = 10; \\nDon't forget that an array of size 10 is indexed from 0 to 9 — indexing counts from zero. This is \\neasy to get wrong, typically when accessing an array with a loop. A check is always made at \\nruntime that the array index given is within the array, so accessing myArray[10] will cause an array \\nbounds error and your program will be terminated. Unlike C, there is no way to access invalid \\nmemory locations. Such indexing errors are common, so check your array indexing and use of \\nloops carefully. A Java array knows its own size, so the expression: \\nmyArray.length; \\nwill return the number of elements in the array. This is a significant difference from C. \\nJava Quick Introduction \\n-15- \\nIt should be noted that a Java array is an abstraction wrapped up inside an object and carefully \\nmanaged, with only valid indexing expressions allowed at runtime. In contrast, a C array is a low-\\nlevel data structure, directly represented in memory and accessed via pointers (memory \\naddresses). Even though a Java array looks like a C array and the square bracket index operator \\nis supported, Java does not support direct memory access or pointers that are memory addresses. While Java supports arrays with C-like square bracket syntax, for most programs you will want to \\nuse more advanced class-based data structures. In particular, class ArrayList that is part of the \\nstandard Java libraries provides a general purpose array-like data structure that has many \\nadvantages over arrays. 14. Enhanced For Loop and Streams \\nWay back in Java 5 an enhanced for loop was introduced for iterating through collections such as \\narrays.\", '14. Enhanced For Loop and Streams \\nWay back in Java 5 an enhanced for loop was introduced for iterating through collections such as \\narrays. We have seen a first example earlier, here is another: \\nfor (int n : anArray) \\n{ \\n  System.out.println(n) \\n} \\nThis can be read as \"for each value n in anArray do ...\". The variable n is initialised to each value \\nstored in the array in turn and can be used inside the loop body. Notice that no counter is needed \\nto index into the array and the loop will work unchanged whatever the size of the array is. This is \\nmore like the Python for loop. Even more Python like is to use Java Streams to iterate an array. A Stream is a sequence of \\nvalues, an abstraction over the idea that a data structure like an array is a sequence of values. If \\nan array is treated as a stream the foreach method can be used to access each value: \\nArrays.stream(anArray).forEach(System.out::println); \\nThe Arrays.stream method is used to create a stream from the array contents, while forEach \\nprints out each value in the stream. The System.out::println syntax is a method reference \\nto the println method allowing the method itself to be passed as a parameter value. Foreach \\ncan then call println on each value it gets to do the printing. 15. Primitive Types and Class Types \\nDeclaring a class also declares a type of the same name. A value of a class type is always an \\nobject. In some object-oriented languages, such as JavaScript3 and Python, all values are \\nrepresented as objects, with no exceptions. Java is a bit different as it also has primitive types, that \\nare represented directly using bits not objects. The Java primitive types are: byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char. Some of these are familiar from the C language but there are several additions. The reason that \\nJava was originally designed with primitive types is for runtime efficiency – faster running code. For \\nsome time, this was considered by quite a lot of programmers to be an anomaly or mistake, and \\nthe idea that ‘everything is an object’ was preferred, as seen in languages like Python.', 'For \\nsome time, this was considered by quite a lot of programmers to be an anomaly or mistake, and \\nthe idea that ‘everything is an object’ was preferred, as seen in languages like Python. However, \\nwith the major advances in runtime language optimisation developed for Java, primitive types have \\nproved to be an advantage, to the point where the representation of objects is being optimised to \\nbe like primitive values. 3 JavaScript may include Java in its name but it is not Java! It is an object-oriented language but supports a \\nvery different object model and type system to Java, even if some of the syntax looks similar. Don’t confuse \\nthe two languages. Java Quick Introduction \\n-16- \\n16. References \\nYou may have noticed that the word reference has been used several times. What is a Java \\nreference? This is a topic that will be explored in detail later in the module, but the idea is that Java objects are \\nalways accessed using references. In some ways a reference is a bit like a pointer, and you will \\noften see references referred to as pointers. However, they are not, repeat not, memory addresses \\nor anything like a C pointer! Instead, a reference is like a marker used to tag an object so it can be \\nlocated and accessed as needed by the Java virtual machine without the programmer having any \\ncontrol over how the underlying mechanism works. This is a very important safety feature for \\nmemory management in Java and languages like Python and JavaScript that use the same \\nconcept of references. Memory management is entirely automated and not under programmer \\ncontrol. 17. Java Strings \\nJava provides extensive support for strings via the library class String. A string variable can be \\ndeclared an initialised with an expression like: \\nString s = “A String”; \\nNote that the string type name is String, with a capital S, and that string literals are placed inside \\ndouble quotes. Java also supports a character type, like C: \\nchar c = ‘a’; \\nLiteral values of type char are bracketed using single quotes. Unlike C strings you do not have to worry about memory allocation, character arrays, array sizes, \\nor using null to mark the end of a string. The String class does all this work for you, and much \\nmore safely! 18. Comparing Strings \\nIntegers and integer variables can be compared using the == operator, for example x == 2.', 'The String class does all this work for you, and much \\nmore safely! 18. Comparing Strings \\nIntegers and integer variables can be compared using the == operator, for example x == 2. The \\nsame operator can be used to compare values of other primitive types. However, strings are \\nobjects and trying to compare strings using == won\\'t work in the way expected. In fact, == will \\ncompare two string objects to see if they are the same object, not if they represent the same \\nsequence of characters. Due to the complex way in which strings objects are managed this may or \\nmay not get you the result you need! In Java, using the == operator to compare objects actually compares the object references. The operator will \\nreturn true if the two references are the same, meaning that both references refer to the same object. Using \\n== to compare two references to different objects will always return false as the references must be different \\neven if the two objects represent the same value. To compare strings properly you need to use the equals and compareTo methods. The equals method will return true if two strings are identical (that is they contain exactly the \\nsame characters in the same order). String s1 = ... String s2 = ... \\nboolean b = s1.equals(s2); \\nb is initialised to true if the strings are the same, false otherwise. You can also use the method equalsIgnoreCase, which will ignore the difference in case \\nbetween letters, so that A is considered the same as a and so on. The compareTo method provides the equivalent of ==, < and >. Java Quick Introduction \\n-17- \\nString s1 = ... String s2 = ... \\nint n = s1.compareTo(s2); \\ncompareTo will return a value less than zero if s1 comes before s2 alphabetically (for example \\n\"hello\" comes before \"world\" in dictionary order). compareTo will return a value of zero if s1 is the same as s2. compareTo will return a value greater than zero if s1 comes after s2 alphabetically. Strings are compared by looking at each character and using the ordering defined for characters. Does A come before or after a, does 1 come before or after a? Try writing some experimental \\nprograms to work out the ordering! More information about comparing strings can be found in the online Javadoc documentation for \\nclass String. 19.', 'Does A come before or after a, does 1 come before or after a? Try writing some experimental \\nprograms to work out the ordering! More information about comparing strings can be found in the online Javadoc documentation for \\nclass String. 19. Accessing characters in a String \\nA string object actually holds an array of characters internally, but this is hidden behind the scenes. Each character can be accessed using the charAt method: \\nString s1 = \"hello\"; \\nchar c = s1.charAt(1); // Get the character \\'e\\' \\nThis is like array indexing, except that the square bracket notation is not used. Indexing still starts \\nfrom 0. 20. Random Numbers \\nRandom numbers can be generated by an object of class Random (look it up in the online Java \\ndocumentation). The following program illustrates the use of a Random object. import java.util.Random; // Don\\'t forget to include this line \\n \\nclass MyRandom  \\n{  \\n  public void displayRandom() \\n  { \\n    Random generator = new Random();  \\n    // Display 10 random integers  \\n    for (int i = 0 ; i < 10 ; ++i)  \\n    {  \\n      System.out.println(generator.nextInt());  \\n    } \\n  } \\n \\n  public static void main(String[] args)  \\n  {  \\n    MyRandom random = new MyRandom(); \\n    random.displayRandom(); \\n  }  \\n}  \\nRandom integers can be any int value (run the program above and see what it displays). The line starting with the keyword import tells the Java compiler that class Random is needed by \\nthe following program and must be present. A similar line is needed to use the ArrayList class \\nbut not for class String. Java Quick Introduction \\n-18- \\nYou might also notice that random numbers are not really random but pseudo-random! This is \\nbecause the random number sequence is calculated using a mathematical formula, which given \\nthe same input values will always calculate the same sequence of numbers. Hence, you may \\nnotice the same sequences re-occurring. You can force a particular sequence by using a seed \\nvalue: \\n    MyRandom random = new MyRandom(1234);  // Supply a seed \\nThe seed value is added to the new MyRandom expression and can be any integer. An alternative way of getting random numbers is to use the utility method Math.random() \\nprovided by class Math.', 'An alternative way of getting random numbers is to use the utility method Math.random() \\nprovided by class Math. See the on-line documentation for more information. Class Math also provides a range of other utility methods implementing common mathematical \\nfunctions.', ' \\n- 1 - \\nclass FileOutput  \\nWri$ng data to a ﬁle  \\n \\nThese notes give an introduc3on to using class FileOutput to write data to ﬁles, for use \\nwith the exercise ques3ons. Data is wri=en to a ﬁle in text format, with int, double and other \\nnumeric types converted into their string representa3on. This matches the kind of content \\nexpected by class FileInput. Wri3ng data to a ﬁle in a binary format is not supported by \\nthis class. Wri3ng data to a ﬁle requires the following steps:  \\n1. Decide what data you want to write to the ﬁle and in which order to write it. For example, \\nthe data for a data record consis3ng of a string, int and double can be wri=en out as three \\nlines of text. There are other more structured formats that are oFen used such as comma \\nseparated values (csv), Json, or XML, but these are s3ll all text based. To read the data back into a program you need to know what the types are, the order in \\nwhich the data appears and how many lines in the ﬁle represent one data record. 2. Determine the ﬁle name and loca3on of the ﬁle to be wri=en, that the path name is \\navailable, either rela3ve or absolute. 3. Try to open the ﬁle for wri3ng by crea3ng a FileOutput object. This will connect your \\nprogram to the ﬁle. Opening a ﬁle can fail if, for instance, the ﬁle or path name is invalid. If \\nthe ﬁle cannot be opened. If opening fails then the program is terminated. This is a bit of a \\ndras3c step but the assump3on is that if the ﬁle cannot be opened then there isn’t really \\nmuch else to do. Note that by default if an exis3ng ﬁle is opened using: \\nFileOutput out = new FileOutput(“somefile.txt”); \\nthen the data already in the ﬁle is overwri,en and lost.', 'Note that by default if an exis3ng ﬁle is opened using: \\nFileOutput out = new FileOutput(“somefile.txt”); \\nthen the data already in the ﬁle is overwri,en and lost. However, you can open a ﬁle in \\nappend mode by adding an addi3onal boolean argument, like this: \\nFileOutput out = new FileOutput(“somefile.txt”, true); \\nNow anything wri=en to the ﬁle is added to the end of the exis3ng content. If is also possible to create a FileOutput object using a File object to represent the ﬁle to be \\nopened. See the Java Documenta3on for informa3on about class File, which is included \\nof the standard Java class library. 4. Write the data to the ﬁle. Typically this is done in a loop, to write a whole sequence of \\ndata. Wri3ng to a ﬁle can also fail unexpectedly (for example, there may be no disk space \\nleF), in which case an error message will be displayed but the program is allowed to \\ncon3nue although it is unlikely to con3nue working correctly. To add a newline at the end of the data just wri=en you must call the writeEndOfLine() \\nmethod, as newlines are not added otherwise, resul3ng in all the output being in a single \\nline with no separator between each item. - 2 - \\n \\n5. Close the ﬁle. This must be done to ensure that all the data you have wri=en to the ﬁle \\nactually gets stored in the ﬁle. Data you write is typically buﬀered somewhere before being \\nwri=en, so is wri=en to a ﬁle in larger units - this is more eﬃcient. If a ﬁle is not closed \\nproperly you may ﬁnd that data is missing from the end of the ﬁle next 3me you try to read \\nit back. The following program shows how data can be wri=en to a ﬁle using the FileOutput class \\nlisted at the end of these notes. public class WriteFile \\n{ \\n  public static void main(String[] args) \\n  { \\n    // Create and open file.', 'public class WriteFile \\n{ \\n  public static void main(String[] args) \\n  { \\n    // Create and open file. FileOutput out = new FileOutput(\"data.txt\"); \\n \\n    // Write different types of value. // Each line must be explicitly separated \\n    // with a newline. out.writeInt(100); \\n    out.writeEndOfLine(); \\n    out.writeLong(1234567L); \\n    out.writeEndOfLine(); \\n    out.writeDouble(1.23456D); \\n    out.writeEndOfLine(); \\n    out.writeFloat(2.34567F); \\n    out.writeEndOfLine(); \\n    out.writeChar(\\'a\\'); \\n    out.writeEndOfLine(); \\n \\n    // With a String, the newline character can be included \\n    // in the String value. out.writeString(\"Hello world\\\\n\"); \\n \\n    // Must close the file when finished otherwise data can be lost. out.close(); \\n  } \\n} \\n \\nData is stored in a ﬁle as text. For example, the integer 12345 is stored as the text ‘12345’ \\n(without quotes), even though it is stored in binary format within a program. Any text data \\nﬁle can be loaded into the IDE for viewing and edi3ng. The program simply stores each item of data (an integer, ﬂoa3ng point number, text string, \\netc.) on a separate line, with a newline used as a marker to indicate the end of the data \\nitem. The data ﬁle wri=en by this program can be read by the ReadFile program listed in \\nthe FileInput class notes. - 3 - \\nClass FileOutput provides a collec3on of write methods matching the set of next<type> \\nmethods in class Input. Class FileInput inherits all the methods from Input, hence can read \\nanything wri=en by FileOutput. To use this class copy/paste the source code from Moodle to a ﬁle called FileOutput.java in \\nyour project. This class can be used in a program at the same 3me as class FileInput, so \\nyou can write programs that do both ﬁle input and output.

There are additional notes on the Moodle site about using Java, and also the classes Input, \\nFileInput and FileOutput for working with keyboard input and files. Look at these as well. Using An IDE \\nYou need to learn how to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) efficiently and the \\nbest way to do that is to use one a lot! For this module you are very strongly recommended to use \\nIntelliJ IDEA, which is by far the best available, see the Moodle site for more information about \\ngetting it. The lectures, notes, and examples will assume you are using IDEA. One of your tasks in \\nthe first week is to get IntelliJ downloaded and installed on your computer (see Moodle). Don’t forget that for each program you write you should create a new IDEA project. It is also possible to use Visual Studio Code with the Microsoft Extension Pack for Java extension \\ninstalled. You will need to have the Java JDK installed on your machine separately as you can’t \\ninstall it via Visual Studio Code. For this module you should use Java 23, although versions from Java 21 will be good enough. The Example Programs \\nWhat follows is a number of example small Java programs to show how the Java syntax works, \\nand to illustrate the kinds of programs you should be writing. There is also quite a bit of explanation \\nof the code, which you will probably want to come back to once you have learnt more about Java. For now you can copy and past the example code to compile and run it, but also try experimenting \\nand maybe writing some of your own code.', 'For now you can copy and past the example code to compile and run it, but also try experimenting \\nand maybe writing some of your own code. You will quickly notice that Java uses the same syntactic style as C. A lot of the code should look \\nfamiliar and you will be able to understand a good amount of it. Of course, there are also many \\nimportant differences in the languages, and Java is a much more complex language than C, but \\nthe programs shown here are using basic features. Example 1.1 Write a class that has the following methods: \\n• public int sumOfDigits(int n) — to find the sum of the integer parameter\\'s digits and return the \\nresult. • public void inputAndProcess(Input in) — to input an integer, call sumOfDigits and display the \\nresult.

You are writing one-class programs to get familiar \\nwith the Java syntax, any non-trivial Java program will have multiple classes. The class uses the Input class to read from the keyboard via the terminal window, or the terminal. To get a copy of the Input class and information about how to use it, see the notes on the Moodle \\nweb site. You should copy and paste the Input class code from Moodle into a second source \\nfile called Input.java, in the same project src directory as the program using the Input class. Class Input is very strict about input being entered correctly, so will terminate the program if the \\ninput is incorrect. For example, if the user types in some letters rather than valid digits, the \\nprogram will display the message ‘Input did not represent an int value. ’and terminate. To avoid the program terminating, a better version of the inputAndProcess method would be this: \\npublic void inputAndProcess() \\n  { \\n    int n = 0; \\n \\n1 Remember that ‘source code’ means the textual representation of the code that you are writing.

An alternative to reading input from the terminal window is to use the GUIInput class that displays \\na simple dialog box into which input can be typed. You can get a copy of the source code of the \\nclass from Moodle as the file GUIInput.java.', 'You can get a copy of the source code of the \\nclass from Moodle as the file GUIInput.java. A copy of the GUIInput.java file should be included in \\nthe same project as the example class (create a new class in IDEA and copy and paste the code \\ninto the editor) and the inputAndProcess method changed to this: \\npublic void inputAndProcess() \\n{ \\n  GUIInput input = new GUIInput(); \\n  int n = input.readInt(\"Type an integer: \"); \\n  System.out.print(\"The sum of the digits of: \" + n);  \\n  System.out.println(\" is: \" + sumOfDigits(n));  \\n} \\nThe GUIInput class provides the following methods for input: \\npublic int readInt(String prompt) \\npublic long readLong(String prompt) \\npublic double readDouble(String prompt) \\npublic float readFloat(String prompt) \\npublic String readString(String prompt) \\npublic char readChar(String prompt) \\nIn each case the parameter called prompt is the prompt to display in the dialog telling the user \\nwhat to type in. If the user types in the wrong kind of value, the dialog will be redisplayed until the \\ncorrect kind of value is entered. If the Cancel button is pressed a default value is returned, zero for \\nthe numerical types, an empty string or a space character. Further thoughts: \\n• Does the program work correctly with negative integers? Copy, compile and run the program to \\nfind out. • Why is the Input object created in the main method and not the inputAndProcess method? Is this \\na good decision? • Do you think that the inputAndProcess method is a good cohesive method? The ‘and’ in the \\nmethod name is a clue! How might you change the method? • Note the use of Math.abs. This is a function implemented as a utility method in class Math (see \\nthe online class documentation for more details: \\nhttps://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/21/docs/api/java.base/java/math/package-summary.html).

Example 1.2 Write a one-class program that has a method to ask for and return the name of a text \\nfile, a method taking a file name (a String) as a parameter that reads and displays each line of text \\nin the file on the screen, and a method to call the first two methods. // Written by A.Person, January 2025 \\n// Answer to Example Question 1.2 \\nclass Example1_2 \\n{ \\n  private void displayFileContent(String filename) \\n  { \\n    FileInput fileIn = new FileInput(filename); \\n    while (fileIn.hasNextLine()) \\n    { \\n      String s = fileIn.nextLine();       \\n      System.out.println(s); \\n    } \\n    fileIn.close(); // Always close a file after it has been used. \\n  } private String getFileName() \\n  { \\n    Input in = new Input(); \\n    System.out.print(\"Enter filename: \"); \\n    String filename = in.nextLine(); \\n    return filename; \\n  } \\n \\n  public void showFile() \\n  { \\n    String filename = getFileName(); \\n    displayFileContent(filename); \\n    // Could have written displayFileContent(getFileName()); \\n  } \\n \\n  public static void main(String[] args) \\n  { \\n    new Example1_2().showFile(); \\n  } \\n} \\nThis uses the FileInput class. To get a copy of the class and information about how to use it, see \\nthe notes on the Moodle web site. Look at the way that data is read from the file in the while loop. The hasNextLine() method will return true if there is more data to read from the file. If it returns \\nfalse the file copy is finished. Note that the methods displayFileContent and getFileName have been made private. The public \\nshowFile method, acting as a controller, is the only one that can be called for an object in the main \\nmethod. Example 1.3 Write a one-class program that uses a method to display a multiplication table, given \\nan integer between 2 and 12 inclusive. The program should ask the user which table to display and \\nreject any invalid request.', 'Example 1.3 Write a one-class program that uses a method to display a multiplication table, given \\nan integer between 2 and 12 inclusive. The program should ask the user which table to display and \\nreject any invalid request. COMP0004 Example Programs \\n-5- \\nThere will be a method that displays the multiplication table, which can be called displayTable. This \\nwill take an integer parameter but does not need to return a result, so can be declared as void \\ndisplayTable(int n). Also there will be a main method, as all programs must have one. However, \\nshould the main method ask the user for input and call displayTable, or should that behaviour be \\nput into another method? The answer to this question lies in an important method design principle: each method should be \\ncohesive — that is, it should focus on doing one, and only one, well-defined chunk of behaviour \\nneeded by the program. Following this principle, the main method can focus on initialising the \\nprogram by creating an object and then call another method to handle the user input. That method \\ncan, in turn, then focus on doing one thing before calling the method to display the table. Hence, \\nwe now have a method called doTable, and established which method calls another. With the methods and their behaviour identified, each can now be looked at in turn to design their \\nrespective method bodies. Moreover, rather than having to consider the entire statement sequence \\nin the program at one go, we are now concerned only with small portions at a time. This has \\ndivided a larger and more complex design problem into a collection of smaller, and more easily \\ndesigned, components. Further each component has a well-defined interface by which it connects \\nto other components. The interface is the name of the method and its parameter list (i.e., the \\nnumber and types of the parameters) and the returned value if not void. The design of each method is now straightforward. Method displayTable needs a loop and output \\nstatements to display a multiplication table, while doTable asks the user to enter a value and \\nchecks it is within the supported range. If it is then displayTable is called, otherwise an error \\nmessage is displayed. // Written by A.Person, January 2025 \\n// Answer to Example Question 1.3 \\n// Program to display a multiplication table.', 'If it is then displayTable is called, otherwise an error \\nmessage is displayed. // Written by A.Person, January 2025 \\n// Answer to Example Question 1.3 \\n// Program to display a multiplication table. public class MultiplicationTable  \\n{ \\n  // Display multiplication table for n. \\n  private void displayTable(final int n)  \\n  { \\n    int counter = 1; \\n    System.out.println(\"The \" + n + \" times table\"); \\n    while (counter < 13)  \\n    { \\n      System.out.print(counter + \" x \" + n); \\n      System.out.println(\" = \" + counter * n); \\n      counter = counter + 1; \\n    } \\n  } \\n \\n  // Input table to be displayed and get it displayed. public void doTable()  \\n  { \\n    Input in = new Input (); \\n    System.out.print(\"Which table (2-12)? \"); \\n    int x = in.nextInt(); \\n    if ((x < 2) || (x > 12))  \\n    { \\n      System.out.println(\"Cannot display that table\"); \\n    }  \\n    else   \\n    { \\n      displayTable(x); \\nCOMP0004 Example Programs \\n-6- \\n    } \\n  } \\n \\n  public static void main(final String[] args)  \\n  { \\n    new MultiplicationTable().doTable(); \\n  } \\n} \\nFurther thoughts:  \\n• Note where the Input object is created in this program. Is this the correct decision? The strategy \\nshould be to always minimise the scope within which a name is visible. • Is the method doTable actually well-designed and cohesive? Perhaps it would be better to \\nchange it so that it only does the input and returns an integer, removing the if statement to a new \\nmethod. A method name should be chosen to help describe what the method does. Are the names chosen \\nin these example programs good enough or can you suggest better names? Does doTable \\nproperly suggest the role of the method? Example 1.4 Write a class that has methods to input a collection of integers, storing them as \\ninteger objects in an ArrayList<Integer>, to sort the ArrayList<Integer> and to display the sorted \\ncontents of the ArrayList<Integer>. The ArrayList<Integer> should be stored using an instance \\nvariable.', 'The ArrayList<Integer> should be stored using an instance \\nvariable. // Written by A.Person, January 2025 \\n// Answer to Example Question 1.4 \\n \\nimport java.util.ArrayList;   // Need to import the class before it \\n                              // can be used. import java.util.Collections; // Class Collections provides a sort \\n                              // method for Collection objects \\n                              // such as ArrayLists. class Example1_4 \\n{ \\n  private ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>(); \\n \\n  private void displayIntegers() \\n  { \\n    for (int i : numbers) \\n    { \\n      System.out.println(i); \\n    } \\n  } \\n \\n  private void inputIntegers() \\n  { \\n    Input in = new Input(); \\n    System.out.print(\"How many integers to input? \"); \\n    int count = in.nextInt(); \\n    for (int n = 0; n < count; n++) \\n    { \\n      System.out.print(\"Enter integer (\" + n + \") : \"); \\n      int value = in.nextInt(); \\n      numbers.add(value); \\nCOMP0004 Example Programs \\n-7- \\n    } \\n  } \\n \\n  private void sortIntegers() \\n  { \\n    // Easy if you can find and use a method in the class library!!

Class Integer is a library class that represents int \\nvalues as objects, in contrast to primitive values of type int, which are not objects. A mechanism \\ncalled auto boxing and unboxing automatically deals with conversions between int values and \\nInteger objects, allowing int values to be stored in an ArrayList<Integer> without needing to do any \\nconversions explicitly. Notice how easy the sorting turned out to be! A suitable sort method already exists in the class \\nlibrary, the only work lies in finding the class and method — use the index in the Java class \\ndocumentation.', 'Notice how easy the sorting turned out to be!

Also notice the loop used to print the ArrayList<Integer>: \\n   for (int i : numbers) \\n    { \\n      System.out.println(i); \\n    } \\nThis is using an enhanced for loop to access each element of the ArrayList<Integer> in turn. Auto-\\nunboxing automatically takes care of converting from the Integer objects stored in the \\nArrayList<Integer> to the int values used in the loop. Example 1.5 Write a one-class program that determines whether a word or sentence is a \\npalindrome. A palindrome reads backwards the same way as forwards, for example: \"Never odd or \\neven\". Spaces and lower/upper case are not considered as significant. Notes: The problem statement gives little information about designing the program, so we definitely \\nneed to do some thinking and planning before trying to write code. First of all we need an algorithm \\nto test whether a string is a palindrome. This turns out to be easy: \\n1. make a copy of the string \\n2. reverse the order of the characters in the copy \\n3. compare the reversed copy with the original to see if they are the same \\nNow that we know that it is possible to check for a palindrome, the next step is to consider the \\noverall sequence of events that should take place when the program runs. This gives: \\nCOMP0004 Example Programs \\n-8- \\n1. input string to test \\n2. make a copy \\n3. do the reverse \\n4. check the reverse copy against the original \\n5. display the answer \\nNext we want to determine what methods are required and allocate the steps listed above to them. We could bundle everything into a single method but that would violate our cohesion guidelines. Instead, we identify the following methods: \\nString getInput() // Get the input string to be tested. (1) \\nString reverse(String s) // Return the reverse of the argument String \\n                         // (2,3) \\nboolean check(String s1, String s2) // Is s2 the reverse of s1? (4) \\nvoid testForPalindrome(String s) // Call the check method and display \\n                                 // the answer (5) \\nThis may seem more methods than necessary.', '(4) \\nvoid testForPalindrome(String s) // Call the check method and display \\n                                 // the answer (5) \\nThis may seem more methods than necessary. That could turn out to be true but at this stage we \\nare deliberately breaking the overall behaviour down into minimally sized methods to get a good \\nfeel for the design. Methods can be combined and behaviour re-allocated later if it seems \\nappropriate. Note that making a copy of a String is a basic operation that does not need to put into \\na separate method on its own. With the methods identified, each can be considered in turn to design its method body. Method \\ngetInput is easy as it simply requests input and returns the resulting string. TestForPalindrome is \\nalso straightforward, it just need to call the check method with the same string for both parameter \\nvalues and display a suitable message giving the result. Check is a bit more interesting as the \\ndecision has been made to make it more general purpose than is strictly necessary for this version \\nof the program. The idea for check is that it can actually test any two strings to see if they are the \\nreverse of each other. TestForPalindrome will call it with the same string for both arguments since \\nit checks for self-reversed strings. Check works by reversing one string and then doing a string \\ncomparison using the compareTo method in the String class. This leaves reverse, which requires a bit more work. The basic strategy here is to unpack the \\noriginal string character by character and reassemble the characters in the reverse order to create \\na new string. To find out how to extract individual characters from a string we need to return the \\ndocumentation for class String. This shows that there is a method declared as char charAt(int \\nindex), which returns the character at position index, counting from 0 as the position of the first \\ncharacter. The String documentation also shows a method int length() that returns the number of \\ncharacters in a String.', 'The String documentation also shows a method int length() that returns the number of \\ncharacters in a String. With these methods we can construct a loop to access each character in \\nturn: \\n// Given some String s \\nint position = 0; \\nwhile (position < s.length())  \\n{  \\n \\n  // Characters run from 0 to length-1 \\n  ...  \\n  s.charAt(position); // Get the character and do something with it \\n  ... \\n  position = position + 1; // Move to next character \\n} \\nCOMP0004 Example Programs \\n-9- \\nBuilding the new string requires a search of the class documentation to find a method to join a char \\nto a String. The String class does not provide one, so we start looking at other classes. It turns out \\nthere is a class Character, whose objects represent characters, that can be used to create a String \\nfrom a single char using an expression like: \\n// Given a char c \\n... new Character(c).toString() ... The toString() method converts from a Character object to a String object. The two strings can then \\nbe concatenated using the + operator. We now have all the pieces ready to write the program. However, a review of the problem \\nstatement to check we are still answering the right question highlights a problem: the sample \\npalindrome is only a palindrome if the case of the letters is ignored and the spaces are ignored. If \\nthe case of the letters or position of spaces is significant then the sample string is not a \\npalindrome. If our current design was applied to this sample string, it would not be accepted as a \\npalindrome. This can be resolved by providing a helper method called tidyString that takes a String \\nas a parameter and returns a String that is a copy without spaces and all letters in lowercase. Before writing the tidyString helper method, a further search of the String class documentation is a \\ngood idea to see if there are existing library methods that can do the work. This reveals the String \\ntoLowerCase() method, which returns a lower case version of the string it is called for, and the \\nString replaceAll(String target, String replacement) method, which will replace all occurrences of \\nthe String target with the String replacement. // Written by A.Person, January 2025 \\n// Answer to Example Question 1.5 \\n// Program to check for a palindrome.', '// Written by A.Person, January 2025 \\n// Answer to Example Question 1.5 \\n// Program to check for a palindrome. public class Palindrome  \\n{ \\n  // Return a String which is the reverse of the argument String \\n  private String reverse(final String s)  \\n  { \\n    String result = new String(); \\n    int position = 0; \\n    while (position < s.length())  \\n    { \\n      result = new Character(s.charAt(position)).toString() + result; \\n      position = position + 1; \\n    } \\n    return result; \\n  } \\n \\n  // Check to see if the two argument Strings are the reverse of each \\n  // other.

Write a program to read in a text file and output the number of characters, words and lines it \\ncontains. Spaces, tabs, newlines and similar characters should all be counted as characters.

This allows data to \\nexist between runs of the same program and to be passed between different programs. These notes give an introduction to using class FileInput to read data from files, for use \\nwith the exercise questions. Reading data from a file using FileInput involves the following steps:  \\n1. Determine what type of data is in the file. A common strategy is to store data as text in a \\nfile. This has the advantage that the data is easy to view and even edit using a standard text \\neditor. Strings and characters are already text so can be read directly, while other types such \\nas int or double values can be stored as text but additionally need to be converted from text \\nback into the correct representation. For simple programs it is sufficient for each piece of \\ndata to be stored one per line. 2. Determine the file name. Often this is done by asking the user to type in a file name. A file \\nname is any valid Unix/Linux/MacOS or Windows file name which may include a relative or \\nabsolute path name. One complication is that Windows path names can include a drive letter and will use back \\nslashes (‘\\\\’), whereas the Unix based operating systems use forward slashes (‘/’) with no \\ndrive letter. If used correctly, Java provides a platform independent representation for path \\nnames. However, a common mistake is to write code that depends on a specific \\nrepresentation on one platform and then unexpectedly fails when run on a different platform. 3. Try to open the file by creating a FileInput object passing the file name as an argument \\nto the constructor. If the file does not exist or cannot be opened the program will terminate \\ndisplaying an error message, unless other action is taken. Actually opening a file is handled \\nby classes from the Java class library and the operating system. As a file might not exist or the filename is given incorrectly it is a good idea to check whether \\nit does exist before creating the FileInput object.', 'Actually opening a file is handled \\nby classes from the Java class library and the operating system. As a file might not exist or the filename is given incorrectly it is a good idea to check whether \\nit does exist before creating the FileInput object. This is done by using the exists \\nmethod, which is called like this:  \\nif (!FileInput.exists(fileName))  \\n{ // Do something if the file doesn’t exist } \\nNote that exists is a static method meaning it is called using the FileInput class name \\nrather than called on an object like the other input methods. The method returns true if the \\nfile exists. 4. Once the file is open, data values can be read item by item from the file. Typically a loop \\nis used to continually read data values until there are no more data available. This is referred \\nto as reaching the \"end of file\" usually abbreviated to eof or EOF. Attempting to read beyond \\nthe end of the file will cause an error message to be displayed but the program will carry on \\nrunning and a default value is returned. Reading data works in the same way and uses the same method as class Input, so refer to \\nthat class for more information about the input methods. - 2 - \\n5. When the data has been read from the file, the file should be closed. This will disconnect \\nthe file from the program and tidy things up. Properly closing a file is important to make sure \\nthat resources held by the file representation in the program are correctly released. Unlike \\nreading from the keyboard using class Input, you do need to call close on the FileInput \\nobject. The FileInput class provides a simple way of reading data from a file without having to \\nknow about streams and exceptions. As such, this is another ‘Toy’ class, and should not be \\nused after streams and exceptions have been introduced. The following example programs show how it is used to read data from files. The first \\nexample program reads a number of different types of value from the data file data.txt:  \\n// Program to illustrate the use of FileInput class by reading a \\n// sequence of values of different types. class ReadFile \\n{ \\n  public static void main(String[] args) \\n  { \\n    String fileName = \"data.txt\"; \\n \\n    // Check that the file exists before trying to \\n    // create a FileInput object.', 'class ReadFile \\n{ \\n  public static void main(String[] args) \\n  { \\n    String fileName = \"data.txt\"; \\n \\n    // Check that the file exists before trying to \\n    // create a FileInput object. // Note that exists is a static method meaning it is \\n    // not called on a FileInput object, \\n    // but called directly using the FileInput class name. if (!FileInput.exists(fileName)) \\n    { \\n      System.err.println(\"File \" + fileName + \" does not exist. \"); \\n      System.exit(1); \\n    } \\n \\n    // Create the FileInput object using the filename \\n    // test1.txt. Any file name (including a full path name) \\n    // can be used, or as here a String variable holding the name \\n    // can be used. FileInput in = new FileInput(fileName); \\n \\n    int n = in.nextInt(); \\n    System.out.println(\"Integer was: \" + n); \\n    long l = in.nextLong(); \\n    System.out.println(\"Long was: \" + l); \\n    double d = in.nextDouble(); \\n    System.out.println(\"Double was: \" + d); \\n    float f = in.nextFloat(); \\n    System.out.println(\"float was: \" + f); \\n \\n    // Before reading a character the newline left  \\n    // in the input buffer after reading the float is  \\n    // removed by reading the rest of the \\n    // buffer. in.nextLine(); \\n    char c = in.nextChar(); \\n \\n- 3 - \\n    System.out.println(\"char was: \" + c); \\n    in.nextLine(); \\n \\n    // After reading a character the newline character is  \\n    // left in the buffer, so is removed. // The next input will then start with the \\n    // next line in the data file. String s = in.nextLine(); \\n    System.out.println(\"String was: \" + s); \\n \\n    // Finished with the file, so close it. in.close(); \\n  } \\n} \\nNote the comments about reading characters of type char. Like reading from the keyboard \\nusing class Input data from a file is read into a buffer line-by-line before it is accessed by \\na program. The data file data.txt contents is this:  \\n   123 \\n   12345 \\n   1.2345 \\n   1.23 \\n   c \\n   This is a string.', 'The data file data.txt contents is this:  \\n   123 \\n   12345 \\n   1.2345 \\n   1.23 \\n   c \\n   This is a string. The contents of the file is simply ordinary characters and text. The file can be created by \\nusing a standard text editor or the IDE to type it in. Each data item (integer, floating point \\nnumber, text string, etc.) should appear on a separate line, as the newline character is used \\nto mark the end of a data item. The second example program shows a loop reading input until there is no more data to read. Note the way that the hasNextChar method is used to check if there is another character to \\nread. // Use a loop to read a sequence of characters. class FileInputTest2 \\n{ \\n  public static void main(String[] args) \\n  { \\n    FileInput in = new FileInput(\"data.txt\"); \\n    // Note that the loop always checks to see if a next \\n    // character is available before inputting it. // hasNexChar will return false when the end of file (eof) \\n    // is reached. while (in.hasNextChar()) \\n    { \\n      char c = in.nextChar(); \\n      System.out.print(c); \\n    } \\n    in.close(); \\n \\n- 4 - \\n  } \\n} \\nWhen run, this program simply displays the contents of the data file on the screen, character \\nby character. The FileInput class provides methods to read values of type int, long, double, float, char \\nand String. The next<type> methods read values of the given type, while the hasNext<type> \\nmethods determine whether there is a value of the given type available to read, returning \\ntrue if there is, false otherwise. If an error occurs when trying to open a file the program is terminated. If reading from a file \\nfails then an error message will be displayed but your program will carry on running with \\ndefault values returned rather than valid data. Using the class is similar to using Input.java. Copy and paste the source code from the \\nMoodle site save it into a file called FileInput.java, in the same directory as where your other \\n.java files are.', \"COMP0004 \\n-1- \\n \\nCOMP0004 Object-Oriented Programming \\nProgramming Exercises 3 \\nAim to complete as many questions as you can by \\nthe end of Reading Week \\n \\nPurpose: Writing Java classes.

The Game of Greed \\nThis game specification comes from a programming exercise created by Tom Love for an \\nOOPSLA-89 conference workshop. It is based on dice games that have been around for a lot \\nlonger and the real origin is probably lost in time. The game is known to be quite boring to actually \\nplay, but makes a very good small-scale design and programming exercise!! Greed is a dice game played between two or more players. The object of the game is to tally points \\nfrom the dice rolls and be the first player to score 5,000 points. There are five dice in the game that \\nare rolled from a cup. To enter the game, a player must score at least 300 points on the first roll of his or her turn; \\notherwise, the player is considered “bust”. If the player goes bust, he or she must wait their turn to \\nroll again. If this first roll produces 300 or more points, then the player has the option of stopping and keeping \\nthe initial score or continuing. To continue, the player rolls only the dice that have not yet scored in \\nthis turn. A player may continue rolling until all the dice have scored or until they go bust. With the exception \\nof the entry roll, a bust is when an individual roll produces no points. The player may stop and keep \\ntheir score after any roll as long as they have not gone bust. If all the dice score on a single role, then the player can continue and roll all the dice again. When a player goes bust or opts to stop, the dice are passed to the next player for their turn. Each player keeps the running total of all the scores from their turns. The score for each dice roll is determined as follows: \\n• Three of a kind (three dice all showing the same value) scores 100 times the face value (e.g, if \\nthree dice are showing 3, then 100 x 3). • But if the face value is one, then it is scored as 1,000 (e.g., there are three dice showing 1). • Single dice showing 1 or 5, score 100 and 50 points respectively.', '• But if the face value is one, then it is scored as 1,000 (e.g., there are three dice showing 1). • Single dice showing 1 or 5, score 100 and 50 points respectively. Finally, the winner is determined after a player collects a total score of 5,000 or more and all \\nplayers have had an equal number of turns. If, for example, a player scores over 5,000 points, they \\nmay still lose if a subsequent player ends up with a greater final score. Examples (for first roll): \\ni) Rolled 44446 = 400 points (three of a kind showing 4) \\nwith the option to roll the 4 & 6 again. ii) Rolled 11111 = 1000 + 100 + 100 = 1200 points (three of a kind, plus two 1s) \\nwith the option to role all five dice again, as all dice scored. iii) Rolled 12315 = 100 + 0 + 0 + 100 + 50 points \\nExercises  3 \\n-6- \\nwith the option to roll the 2 & 3 again. Implement this game using classes and objects. It is up to you whether you want to include \\ncomputer players or a user interface to allow human players (a terminal based interface is just \\nfine). To better understand how the game is played, try playing it using real dice with some friends. Below is a class diagram showing one set of classes that might be used to implement the game.

UCL COMPUTER SCIENCE\\nSummary\\n• Covered a range of core technologies needed \\nto build web application. • URLs, IP Addresses, DNS\\n• HTML, CSS, JavaScript. • Responsive Design\\n• Bootstrap. • The Java cloud developer needs to understand \\nand use all of these. • Entirely open source! 95', ' \\n- 1 - \\nExample Simple Order System Use Cases \\n \\nA use case describes the steps required to carry out a task using the applica8on, referred to \\nas the System here. The steps are a dialog between the user (e.g., the Sales Assistant) and \\nthe System across the system boundary – the user interface, whichever form it will take. The \\nuser performs an ac8on, such as entering a value and pressing return, the System responds, \\nand the cycle repeats un8l the use case completes. There can be mul8ple paths through a use case, referred to as use case scenarios. A step in a \\nuse case can lead to an alterna8ve response, shown as extensions, for example to manage \\ninvalid input or other condi8ons. Each scenario must lead to the use case comple8ng. The \\nuse case needs to cover all possible paths through a use case so that the use case can end in \\na known state. Not shown in the examples, but s8ll relevant, are error paths where the use case cannot \\ncomplete and must be cancelled, unwinding any intermediate changes so that invalid or \\nincomplete data is not leG in the System. A Primary Actor is an external role that someone or something plays when the use case is \\ncarried out. In the examples below the Primary Actor is a role for a person, but the actor can \\nbe other en88es, soGware, or external systems. Another use for a use case is to generate test case scenarios, for tes8ng the working \\nsoGware when it is created. These will be func8onal tests rather than unit tests as they test \\na use case scenario, which is a whole slice of behaviour. The func8onal tests should aim to \\ncover each use case scenario, so there will be mul8ple tests for each use case. Unit tests are \\nﬁner grained, aimed at tes8ng small sec8ons of code such as individual methods. Use cases describe an external view of behaviour. They do not describe how the system \\nworks internally, how it is designed or implemented. For example, from the external view \\ndata can be validated and saved but the use case does not deﬁne the algorithms for \\nvalida8ng or saving, or the format of the saved data.', \"For example, from the external view \\ndata can be validated and saved but the use case does not deﬁne the algorithms for \\nvalida8ng or saving, or the format of the saved data. A use case will cover one or more func8onal requirements, and it should be the case that all \\nfunc8onal requirements are covered by the full set of use cases. If a use case doesn’t cover \\nany of the requirements, then it shouldn’t be included as there isn’t any use for it based on \\nthe requirements. Like func8onal requirements, use cases need to be reviewed and reﬁned in itera8ve steps. Ideally the review(s) include the stakeholders who can conﬁrm that each use case does \\nactually do what they need. This reinforces the need for use cases to give an external view of \\nbehaviour that can be understood by stakeholders, without technical or design knowledge of \\nthe system implementa8on being needed. - 2 - \\n \\nUse Case 1: Add New Customer \\n \\nPrimary Actor: Sales Assistant \\n \\nGoal: To add a new Customer record to the System.

Goal: Complete as many of the questions as you can. If you are keeping up, you need to do at \\nleast the core questions. The additional questions are more challenging and are designed to \\nstretch the more confident programmers. If you can't do them now, be prepared to come back and \\ntry them later on. You should complete at least the core questions and get them reviewed in a lab \\nsession. Feedback: It is important that you get feedback on your answers so that you know they are \\ncorrect, that you are not making common mistakes, that the program code is properly presented \\nand that you are confident you have solved the problem properly. To do this, get your answers \\nreviewed by a TA during lab sessions. Getting Started \\nThese exercises require you to work with the example SimpleOrderSystem program. Create a \\nproject by getting the code from the GitHub repository: \\nhttps://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0004SimpleOrderSystem \\nThere is a video on Week 3 Moodle showing how to do this if you are not sure how. This is optional but strongly recommended: You should know how to use the Git version \\ncontrol system! Create and use a local git repository, so that you are making regular commits as \\nyou work on these exercises. Start by creating a local repository and adding the classes from \\nSimple Order System as the first commit. Ideally you should also create a cloud repo on GitHub, \\nso that you can push your local commits up to your cloud repo. See the Week 3 section on Moodle for links on getting started with Git. Exercise Questions \\nEach of these questions involves working with, modifying and/or extending the \\nSimpleOrderSystem application. Start by reading through the code so that you understand it.

Hint: But you have read through all the code to see what is already there haven’t you? UCL COMPUTER SCIENCE \\nExercises 4 \\n-2- \\nTo avoid having to enter example data manually every time you run the code to test it, add a \\nmethod in class SimpleOrderSystem, where the main method is, to add example data by creating \\nobjects and calling methods. Q2. A Customer’s postcode needs to be stored separately from their address (e.g., number, street, \\ntown). Modify the Customer class and any other methods in other classes to support this. Q3. Turn class Product into an abstract class and provide two or more subclasses for specific \\nkinds of product. The method getDescription should be made abstract and the instance variable \\ndescription removed from Product. Each subclass should support the common set of methods \\ninherited from class Product, override the getDescription method, and can add additional \\ninformation. For example, you might have a Book class that adds title, author, publication date, \\netc., with getDescription returning a string containing the information in a suitable format. Think \\ncarefully about the constructors needed for each class. Update the rest of the program to support \\nthe addition of the subclasses. Note, where possible the code in the program as a whole should still use variables of type Product \\nand have an ArrayList<Product> to store the full collection of products. The subclass names only \\nneed to be used when objects are created in a new expression. Q4. Add the ability to display a list of each order that includes a selected product. For each order, \\nthe customer name should also be displayed. Q5a. Add the ability to load and save data to or from a text file.

In programming, the backslash character (‘\\\\’) is known as the escape character. It alters \\nthe interpretation of the character that immediately follows it within a string literal. This \\nmechanism allows for the inclusion of characters in strings that would otherwise be \\nchallenging to represent directly. The term “escape” originates from the idea of escaping from the normal interpretation \\nof characters. By using an escape character, a programmer can override the default \\nmeaning of a normal character, allowing for the inclusion of characters within strings \\nthat either don’t have a visible representation or already have a speciﬁc meaning in the \\nprogramming language such as double-quote which is used to denote string literals. A sequence like  ‘\\\\n’ is termed an escape sequence. The backslash ‘\\\\’ signals that the \\nsubsequent character, ‘n’, should be interpreted in a special way. Speciﬁcally, ‘\\\\n’ \\nrepresents a newline character, instructing the output position to move to the beginning \\nof the next line. Common examples of escape sequences include: \\n• \\\\n for newline (move to the next line of output) \\n• \\\\r for a carriage return (move to the start of a line of output) \\n• \\\\t for a horizontal tab \\n• \\\\\\\\ for a literal backslash \\n• \\\\\" for a double quote \\n \\nEscape sequences are essential for embedding control characters like ‘\\\\n’ within \\nstrings. Control characters are those that ‘control’ the positioning where the next \\ncharacter actually appears when outputting text. Escape sequences are also needed for characters like double-quotes and backslash \\nwhich have a speciﬁc meaning in the syntax of a programming language and would \\nresult in an error if used unescaped. For example, with a string literal like this: \\n“This is a “quote” about something”  \\nthe ﬁrst closing quote would mark the end of the string and the following word ‘quote’ \\nwould cause a syntax error. A normal literal character is a single character that has a visible representation, like the \\nalphabetic characters on a keyboard, and can be used normally in a string literal. Escape sequences then enable developers to format strings in ways that would be \\ncumbersome or impossible using only literal characters. Note, that an escape sequence is what you see or edit in a string literal.', 'Escape sequences then enable developers to format strings in ways that would be \\ncumbersome or impossible using only literal characters. Note, that an escape sequence is what you see or edit in a string literal. The actual \\ncharacter value that is stored in the string representation will be a numerical value. In \\nASCII newline ‘\\\\n’ is represented by the value 10, a one byte value. In Unicode it is \\nrepresented by U+000A, which depending on the speciﬁc Unicode encoding in use can \\nbe 1, 2 or 4 bytes. In summary, a representation like ‘\\\\n’ is called an escape sequence because the \\nbackslash ‘\\\\’ serves as an escape character, modifying the interpretation of the \\nsubsequent n to represent a newline, rather than the literal character ‘n’.', \" \\n \\nCOMP0004 Exercises 5 \\n \\n1 of 5 \\n \\nCOMP0004 Object-Oriented Programming \\nProgramming Exercises 5 \\n \\nPurpose: A more complex Java programming task to help you understand interfaces, abstract \\nclasses, generics, nested classes, inheritance, overriding methods and using exceptions.

Writing a Set Class \\nA set data structure represents a mathematical set, which stores a collection of values of the same \\ntype with no duplicates. This exercise is about implementing set classes, making use of interfaces, \\n \\n \\nCOMP0004 Exercises 5 \\n \\n2 of 5 \\ngenerics, an abstract class, inheritance, overridden methods and exceptions. The Java language \\nfeatures needed to implement these classes are covered in the lectures and other material on \\nMoodle, but it would be a good idea to read up on them as well. The goal is to set up a framework that will support several classes providing different concrete set \\nimplementations. The framework structure is shown above. This framework is based on the principles used by the data structure classes in the standard Java \\nlibraries but is intended to illustrate a range of programming concepts rather than be a fully \\npractical design for a real framework. The Iterable interface is defined in the standard Java class library and declares the iterator \\nmethod, so that each value stored in a data structure can be accessed, or iterated, in sequence. Implementing the Iterable interface also allows the values stored in a data-structure object to be \\naccessed in sequence using the enhanced for loop (for each), and using forEach with Streams. The MySet interface defines the common methods for all set classes.\", 'The MySet interface defines the common methods for all set classes. It is named MySet to avoid \\nconfusion with the Set class in the Java class Library, which you do not need to use at all. MySet \\nextends the Iterable interface, remembering that one interface can extend another. A variable of \\ntype MySet can reference any set object of a class that implements MySet (or inherits the \\nimplements relationship). This enables ‘Programming to an Interface’, allowing code to be written \\nusing the MySet type without needing to be concerned about the exact type of set of objects it is \\nworking with at runtime. For these exercises you are given the code of a basic version of the MySet framework as a \\nstarting point, including one example set implementation called ArrayMySet. You will find this \\ncode in a GitHub repository at: \\nhttps://github.com/UCLComputerScience/2025-COMP0004MySet \\nClone this repo into your working directory on your local machine and then load it into IDEA by \\ncreating a new project, or create a new project directly by cloning. Note that you cannot push to the \\nrepo, but you can connect it to your own GitHub repo if you create one and push to that. The MySet code uses generics so that the classes and interfaces are parameterised over the type \\nof value held in a set. Hence, when declaring a variable of type MySet you would have: \\nMySet<Integer> set; // Reference to a set of Integers. When you look at the MySet interface you will see that it declares the type parameter like this: \\npublic interface MySet<T extends Comparable<T>> extends Iterable<T> \\n \\nThe <T extends Comparable<T>> means that the type T is constrained to be Comparable or \\na subtype of Comparable. Comparable is an interface that defines the compareTo method to \\ncompare the values of two objects (see the Javadoc for a full explanation). This constraint is \\nnecessary as the values held in a set must be comparable to ensure that there are no duplicates in \\nthe set. A set can only hold values of types that implement the Comparable interface, which \\ninclude Integer, Double, String, or any class you write that implements Comparable. Some MySet methods are declared as throwing exceptions of type MySetException, and a \\ndefault maximum size is imposed on all sets of 1000 values.', 'Some MySet methods are declared as throwing exceptions of type MySetException, and a \\ndefault maximum size is imposed on all sets of 1000 values. A different maximum size can be \\nspecified when a set object is created. If an attempt is made to to create a set with size greater \\nthan the maximum size, or less than 1, an exception should be thrown. In addition, if adding a \\nvalue to a set would cause it to exceed the maximum size an exception should be thrown. The AbstractMySet class is an abstract class that provides common methods to be inherited by \\nconcrete subclasses. This avoids duplicating the methods in the subclasses as they can just be \\ndefined once and inherited. In the code you get from GitHub you will see that a number of methods \\nare included but are not complete. You will need to add the missing code. For example, the union \\n \\n \\nCOMP0004 Exercises 5 \\n \\n3 of 5 \\nmethod is intended to find the set union between the set the method is called on and the set \\npassed as a parameter. A new set containing the union is returned, with the new set object created \\nusing a Factory. A factory is a class that specialises in creating objects. The use of a factory avoids \\ncode having to name a specific concrete set class and decouples object creation from class \\nnaming. Factory is an example of a Design Pattern. Class MySetFactory implements a basic factory. When a program using sets is started, the \\nMySetFactory is given the name of the set class (a String) that it will create objects of. The \\nMySetFactory also implements the Singleton Pattern, meaning that only one instance object of \\nthe class can be created when the program is run (see the example code in the Main class \\nincluded with the framework code). A complete example set implementation class, ArrayMySet, is provided that uses an ArrayList \\nas the private internal data structure used to store the values in the set. A private nested (member) \\nclass is used to implement the Iterator interface to enable iteration of the set object. Don’t \\nconfuse Iterable with Iterator. Iterable defines the iterator method, while Iterator \\ndefines the next and hasNext methods. Note that class ArrayMySet throws exceptions but does not catch any of its own exceptions. A \\nset throws exceptions, while code using a set catches any exceptions using try/catch blocks.', 'Note that class ArrayMySet throws exceptions but does not catch any of its own exceptions. A \\nset throws exceptions, while code using a set catches any exceptions using try/catch blocks. Make \\nsure you understand the point being made here. Core Questions \\nThe initial code can be obtained from the GitHub repo. This code will compile and run but won’t do \\nanything useful until the missing method code is implemented. There are no guarantees that the \\ncode does not contain errors - check carefully! Do not change any of the public method names in the MySet interface or MySetFactory, or \\nany of the parameter or return types. Also use the class names specified in the questions. The GitHub content includes a Main class that is intended to contain code that uses the classes \\nand code that you write, to demonstrate that the code works correctly. As you answer the \\nquestions below you should extend the Main class with more methods to confirm the answers \\nwork. It will be important to keep the code in the Main class well-organised and properly written, \\ndon’t let it become a mess. If you feel that your Main class is getting too large and unfocussed, \\nthen split it into two or more smaller classes. For example, the code to confirm that Q5 works could \\nbe put into another class. Q1. Complete the missing method bodies in class AbstractMySet, so that the code will compile \\nand you can create and use ArrayMySet objects. The union, intersection and difference \\nmethods must all be implemented in the abstract class and inherited by the concrete subclasses. You should not implement the methods in the subclasses, or copy and paste the code into other \\nclasses. Q2. Add a method with the signature String toString() to the AbstractMySet class, that \\nreturns a string representation of the contents of a set in this style: \\n{ value1, value2, ... } \\nRemember that toString() is a method declared in class Object (the superclass of all other \\nclasses), and can be overridden by any of your classes to specialise the way it represents an \\nobject’s value as a string. No code in any concrete subclasses should be changed, they can inherit \\nthe method you add to AbstractMySet. The example code in the Main class will be helpful for \\nthis question.

Installing jshell \\njshell comes bundled with Java Development Kit (JDK) 9 or later. If you have JDK 21, JDK \\n23, or any LTS (Long-Term Support) release, you should already have jshell installed. Check if Java is installed by running: \\n \\njava -version \\n \\nIf you see a version number of 9 or higher, you’re good to go. Check for jshell by running: \\n \\njshell --version \\n \\nThis should print out the jshell version. If it’s not found, check your JDK installation. 3. Starting jshell \\nOpen a terminal window, command prompt window, or shell view in the IDE and type: \\n \\njshell \\n \\nYou should see a prompt that looks like: \\n \\n|  Welcome to JShell -- Version 23 \\n|  For an introduction type: /help intro \\n \\njshell>  \\n \\nYou’re now in the jshell environment, ready to type and run Java code interactively. 4. Basic Commands and Usage \\nThese are some essential jshell commands: \\n• \\n/help: Shows general help. - 2 - \\n• \\n/help intro: Displays a quick-start guide to jshell. • \\n/vars: Lists the variables you’ve declared. • \\n/methods: Lists the methods you’ve deﬁned. • \\n/exit: Exits jshell. Or use Ctrl-D. \\n \\nUse the up/down arrow keys to browse your command history, by moving through the \\ncommands you have previously typed. Sometimes you need to use semicolons to end statements, but jshell is ﬂexible and \\nsemicolons are often optional. Try typing: \\n \\njshell> /help intro \\n \\nto get a short introduction and list of commands.', 'Try typing: \\n \\njshell> /help intro \\n \\nto get a short introduction and list of commands. 5. Trying Out Basic Java Expressions \\njshell allows you to type in expressions and see immediate results: \\n \\njshell> 2 + 3 \\n$1 ==> 5 \\n \\n$1 is jshell’s automatic variable name for the result of the expression. If you type 2 + 3 again, you might see $2 ==> 5, and so on. You can evaluate any valid Java expressions or statements: \\n \\njshell> 10 * 5 \\n$1 ==> 50 \\n \\njshell> (5 + 3) / 2.0 \\n$2 ==> 4.0 \\n \\njshell> String greeting = \"Hello, jshell!\" greeting ==> \"Hello, jshell!\" jshell> greeting.toUpperCase() \\n$3 ==> \"HELLO, JSHELL!\" 6. Deﬁning Variables \\nYou can deﬁne and initialise variables using types (e.g., int, double, String, custom \\nclasses), or using var and type inference. jshell> int number = 42 \\nnumber ==> 42 \\n \\njshell> double price = 19.99 \\nprice ==> 19.99 \\n \\n- 3 - \\n \\njshell> String city = \"New York\" \\ncity ==> \"New York\" \\n \\njshell> var x = 10 \\nx ==> 10 \\n \\nTo see a list of all variables you’ve declared so far, type: \\n \\njshell> /vars \\n|    int number = 42 \\n|    double price = 19.99 \\n|    String city = \"New York\" \\n|    int x = 10 \\n \\nNotice that x was declared using var but its type has been inferred as int, so that when \\nyou list the variables you see int x = 10. If you redeﬁne a variable, the previous deﬁnition is replaced: \\njshell> double price = 40.25 \\nprice ==> 40.25 \\n \\nThe type can change: \\njshell> String price = \"Very expensive!\" price ==> \"Very expensive!\"', 'price ==> \"Very expensive!\" Type checking is done: \\njshell> int n = 1.23 \\n|  Error: \\n|  incompatible types: possible lossy conversion from double to int \\n|  int n = 1.23; \\n|          ^--^ \\nYou can use the up-arrow key to bring the deﬁnition back to edit it. 7. Writing Methods in jshell \\nYou can deﬁne methods right in jshell to test them out: \\n \\njshell> int square(int x) { \\n   ...>     return x * x; \\n   ...> } \\n|  created method square(int) \\n \\njshell> square(5); \\n$1 ==> 25 \\n \\njshell recognises the Java syntax and allows newline to be used at the end of each line \\nof the method as you type it in, so the deﬁnition can spread out over multiple lines as \\nnormal. In addition, you can move the cursor around using the arrow keys to make \\nchanges. - 4 - \\nIf you press Return and have a syntax error, then an error message is displayed, but \\nagain you can use the up-arrow key to go back and carry on editing the method to ﬁx the \\nproblem. You can deﬁne multiple methods, jshell will keep them available in the session. You can \\nlist them with: \\n \\njshell> /methods \\n \\nMethods can also be overloaded. 8. Creating and Using Classes \\nOne of the main reasons to learn Java is to use classes and objects, core to object-\\noriented programming. In jshell, you can deﬁne a class inline: \\n \\njshell> class Person { \\n   ...>     private String name; \\n   ...>     private int age; \\n   ...>      \\n   ...>     // Constructor \\n   ...>     public Person(String name, int age) { \\n   ...>         this.name = name; \\n   ...>         this.age = age; \\n   ...>     } \\n   ...>      \\n   ...>     // Method \\n   ...>     public void sayHello() { \\n   ...>         System.out.println(\"Hello, my name is \" + name + \"!', '\"); \\n   ...>     } \\n   ...> } \\n|  created class Person \\n \\nNow you can create an object (instance) of this class: \\n \\njshell> Person someone = new Person(\"Someone\", 20); \\nalice ==> Person@4554617c \\n \\njshell> someone.sayHello(); \\nHello, my name is Someone! 9. Importing Packages and Libraries \\nTo use external libraries or even common Java packages (like java.util. *), you can import \\nthem just like normal: \\n \\njshell> import java.util.ArrayList; \\n \\njshell> ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>(); \\nlist ==> [] \\n \\njshell> list.add(\"Java\"); \\n$1 ==> true \\n \\n- 5 - \\n \\njshell> list.add(\"OOP\"); \\n$2 ==> true \\n \\njshell> list \\n$3 ==> [Java, OOP] \\n \\njshell will remember all your imports, classes, and variables within the same session. 10. Useful jshell Editing Features \\njshell includes commands that help you manage or edit your code: \\n• /list: Shows you the history of code items you’ve typed in this session, along with \\nan ID number for easy reference. • /edit <snippet-id>: Lets you open an editor to modify an item of code by its ID \\n(e.g., /edit 5). The ID is shown when you use /list. • /open <ﬁle>: Reads and executes a ﬁle containing Java source code. For instance: \\njshell> /list \\n   1 : int number = 42; \\n   2 : number \\n   3 : class Person { ... } \\n \\njshell> /edit 3 \\n \\nThis opens an in-shell editor or external editor (depending on your setup) to edit item #3, \\nwhich is your Person class deﬁnition. 11. Saving and Loading Sessions \\nIf you want to save your current jshell deﬁnitions and continue later, you can do so: \\n \\njshell> /save mySession.jsh \\n \\nThis stores all current deﬁnitions—variables, methods, classes—into a ﬁle named \\nmySession.jsh. To load them back in a future session: \\n \\njshell> /open mySession.jsh \\n \\nYour classes, methods, and variables from that ﬁle will be restored in the current jshell \\nsession.', 'To load them back in a future session: \\n \\njshell> /open mySession.jsh \\n \\nYour classes, methods, and variables from that ﬁle will be restored in the current jshell \\nsession. 12. Exiting jshell \\nWhen you’re done with your session, just type: \\n \\njshell> /exit \\n| \\nGoodbye \\n \\n- 6 - \\n \\nOr use Ctrl-D (hold down the control key and press the ‘d’ key, shift is not needed). Summary \\njshell is an interactive, real-time environment for editing and running small sections of \\nJava code, ideal for learning and experimenting. It is lightweight, quick, and doesn’t \\nrequire a project to be set up. You can type Java code directly, create variables, deﬁne methods and classes, and see \\nresults immediately. It’s a good way of developing your understanding of Java \\nfundamentals and object-oriented principles before moving on to larger applications \\nand IDE-based development.', '© UCL CS 2025.

Write a program to read in text file and output the number of characters, words and \\nlines it contains. Spaces, tabs, newlines and similar characters should all be counted as \\ncharacters. Words should contain only a-z and A-Z. Hyphens, quotes, digits and any other \\ncharacters are not part of a word. This means, for example, that words hyphenated like ‘on-\\ntime’ are treated as two words. This answer takes the approach of creating a class to provide the service of counting the \\ncharacters, words and lines in a text file. An object can be created, given a file to read from, \\ndo the counting, and provide access to the results. The counting strategy is to read the file one character at a time, then check if the character \\nis a letter (a-z or A-Z) and finally to check for a newline. At each stage the relevant counter is \\nincremented, with the counters represented by the instance variables characters, \\nwords and lines. To determine if there a word has been found a boolean flag called inWord is used, which \\nis set to false when a character is not a letter, and set to true when a character is a letter \\nand the flag is false. Setting the flag to true denotes the start of a word, and the word count \\ncan be incremented. Class Character provides a method called isLetter to determine whether a character is a \\nletter, and this is used in preference to writing a method. This works well enough for a-z and \\nA-Z used in English, but the definition of what is a letter is more complicated than you might \\nthink. Take a look at the Javadoc documentation for class Character to find out more.', 'This works well enough for a-z and \\nA-Z used in English, but the definition of what is a letter is more complicated than you might \\nthink.

On Unix based systems there is a utility program called ‘wc’ (word count) that ‘… displays \\nthe number of lines, words, and bytes contained in each input file …’. This has been available \\nsince the very early days of Unix. The output of the ‘wc’ program was compared with the output of the Java code to check \\nthat the code was producing correct answers. The character and line counts were found to \\nbe consistently equal, but the word count could vary by plus or minus a few words. The \\nissue here is what is defined as a word. The Java code above simply assumes a sequence of \\none or more letters with no other characters. Apostrophes, hyphens and other punctuation \\nare treated as breaks between words. This means, for example, that “it’s” will be treated as \\ntwo words. The ‘wc’ program has its own definition of what is a word, which is not exactly \\nthe same, explaining the small differences between the programs. Read the ‘wc’ manual \\npage to find out what it does. There is one other issue that the Java code above does not fully address, and that is: what is \\na newline? On Unix-based systems newline is the single character ‘\\\\n’, while on Windows \\nnewline is represented by two characters ‘\\\\r\\\\n’. Given that both representations contain ‘\\\\n’ \\nthis doesn’t actually affect counting lines, but the issue is mentioned here as it can cause \\nproblems in some applications where the difference matters. For example, the ‘\\\\r’ could be \\nincorrectly treated as a character in a word when processing a text file created on Windows. The issue is recognised in Java as the System class provides a method that returns the end of \\nline representation for the operating system that the Java program is running on: \\n \\nString endOfLine = System.lineSeparator(); \\n \\nThis allows a Java program to be written so that it will work correctly with the \\nrepresentation in use on the machine it is running on. - 4 - \\nYou might wonder what ‘\\\\r’ and ‘\\\\n’ actually mean.', '- 4 - \\nYou might wonder what ‘\\\\r’ and ‘\\\\n’ actually mean. They are ‘carriage return’ and ‘line feed’, \\nwhich make sense if you think about manual typewriters and the teletype printers in use as \\nterminals when Unix was being created. The carriage return operation moved the carriage \\nposition, where the next character is typed, back to the start of the line on the left. The \\nnewline operation moved the paper up one line. The combination meant that the next \\ncharacter printed would be at the start of the next line. Hence, ‘\\\\r’ and ‘\\\\n’ are control \\ncharacters for the teletype or printer to position the printing position and are not visible \\ncharacters that are printed.', 'COMP0004 Object-Oriented Programming\\nExample Answer for Programming Exercises 3 \\nQuestion 2\\nQ2. A Range represents a sequence, or range, of integers, for example 1 to 10, 3 to 15, or -6 to 3. Write a class Range in Java with the following methods:\\n• a constructor\\u2028\\npublic Range(int lower, int upper)\\u2028\\nThe range includes all the integers from the lower limit to the upper limit inclusive. For example, \\nthe range 2 to 4 includes 2, 3 and 4. The lower limit must be lower than the upper limit otherwise \\nthe constructor will throw an exception. • A method int getLower() to return the lower limit. • A method int getUpper() to return the upper limit. • A method boolean contains(int n) that returns true if the parameter value n is in the \\nrange, false otherwise. • A method getValues() that returns an ArrayList<Integer> containing all the values in the \\nrange in order. Write a second class, with a main method, to use Range objects and confirm they work correctly. Note that your Range class should not do any input or output, or have a main method. Example Answer:\\nThe first thing is to review the specification given in the question to make sure the right kind of \\nrange gets implemented. A range can be exclusive meaning that the upper limit is not included in \\nthe range, or inclusive so the upper limit is included. For example, the exclusive range 1 to 4 \\ncontains 1, 2, 3 but not 4, while the inclusive range contains 1, 2, 3 and 4. Range representations \\nin programming are typically exclusive by default, the range class in Python being a good example. Interestingly, the standard Java class library does not have a Range class, although there is a way \\nto define a range using streams. Fortunately the question makes clear that an inclusive range is being implemented as it gives a \\nclear example of the range 2 to 4 containing 2, 3 and 4. Note, also, that the question specifies that \\nthe lower limit must be lower than the upper limit, meaning that a range must have at least two \\nvalues. The actual Range class is straightforward to write, with two instance variables tom store the lower \\nand upper limits.', 'The actual Range class is straightforward to write, with two instance variables tom store the lower \\nand upper limits. The constructor and method bodies are then easy to fill in. import java.util.ArrayList;\\npublic class Range\\n{\\n  private int lower;\\n  private int upper;\\n  public Range(int lower, int upper) throws IllegalArgumentException\\n  {\\n    if (lower >= upper) throw new IllegalArgumentException();\\n- -\\n1\\nDEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE\\nCOMP0004 Exercises 3 Question 2\\n    this.lower = lower;\\n    this.upper = upper;\\n  }\\n  public int getUpper()\\n  {\\n    return upper;\\n  }\\n  public int getLower()\\n  {\\n    return lower;\\n  }\\n  public boolean contains(int n)\\n  {\\n    return (n >= lower) && (n <= upper);\\n  }\\n  public ArrayList<Integer> getValues()\\n  {\\n    ArrayList<Integer> values = new ArrayList<>();\\n    for (int i = lower; i <= upper; i++) values.add(i);\\n    return values;\\n  }\\n}\\nAs specified the constructor throws an exception if the lower and upper values provided don’t \\nrepresent a valid range.

The challenge is to learn enough Java to get programming quickly! Goal: Complete as many of the exercise questions as you can. If you are keeping up, you need to do at least the core questions. The additional questions are more challenging and are designed to stretch the more confident programmers. If you can\\'t do them now, be prepared to come back and try them later on. You must complete the core questions and get them reviewed in a lab session. Feedback: It is important that you get feedback on your exercise answers so that you know they are correct, that you are not making common mistakes, that the program code is properly presented and that you are confident you have solved the problem properly. To do this, get your answers reviewed by a TA during lab sessions. See the additional notes on the COMP0004 Moodle site about using Java, and classes Input, FileInput and FileOutput. Using An IDE You need to learn how to use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) efficiently and the best way to do that is to use one a lot! For this module you are very strongly recommended to use IntelliJ IDEA, which is by far the best available, see the Moodle site for more information about getting it. The lectures, notes, and examples will assume you are using IDEA. Don’t forget that for each program you write you should create a new IDEA project. It is also possible to use Visual Studio Code with the Microsoft Extension Pack for Java extension installed. You will need to have the Java JDK installed on your machine separately as you can’t install it via Visual Studio Code. Java Version For these exercises you should use Java 23 if available to you, although older versions from Java 15 will be good enough for these exercises. Core questions These exercise questions assume you have followed the Practice Examples notes in Week 1 of the module. You should have already written answers to some of these questions in C last term! Make sure you can also answer them using Java. Don’t forget to pay attention to how your source code is formatted, and keep your methods short and cohesive. Practice using the features in the IDEA IDE, in particular editor short cuts, code- completion and debugging. Don’t forget that you create a new IDE project for each program you write. Q1.1 Write a program that inputs a sequence of Strings until the word stop is entered. DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE COMP0004 Notes and Exercises 1 -2- Hint: You compare strings using compareTo, as outlined in the preceding notes. Q1.2 Write a program to input 10 doubles (values of type double) and store them in an array. Then compute and display the average of the values input. Try entering negative as well as positive numbers. Consider writing one method to do the input and another to compute the average. Q1.3 Write a program to input 10 words, storing them as strings in an ArrayList<String> (not an array), and then display the words in reverse sorted order. Q1.4 Write a program to generate 10000 random doubles between -0.9999999 and +0.9999999. Print out the largest, smallest and the average values. Do you need an array? Think very carefully about this. Hint: Look at the documentation for class Random and find the method nextDouble. Another hint: Negative values?? Class Random also has nextBoolean... Note: Answers to the following questions involve writing programs consisting of two or more methods (not including the main method). Q1.5 Write a one-class program that has the following methods: • a method that inputs and returns a double value, • a method that takes two double parameters, adds them together and returns the square root of the result, • a main method to create an object and call the other two methods, displaying the result of calling the second method. Q1.6 Repeat Q1.5 but store the double values in two instance variables rather than using parameters. Hint: you will need another instance method to call the input method to get values to store in each instance variable and to call the other methods. This instance method should be public, the others private. The input method should be unchanged. Q1.7 Write a method: public String toBase(int n, int b) that converts n to its String representation in number base b, i.e., toBase(3,2) will return \"11\". Put the method into a one-class program that allows you to input values and use the method. Q1.8 Write methods to do the following: • Convert from millimetres to feet. • Convert from metres to inches. • Convert from kilometres to yards. COMP0004 Notes and Exercises 1 -3- Include the methods in an interactive program that lets the user select which conversion to perform, and then inputs a value and displays the result. An interactive program means one that displays a simple text menu, such as: 1. Convert millimetres to feet. 2. Convert metres to inches. 3. Convert kilometres to yards. 4. Quit and then asks the user to type in a value from 1 to 4 to select which action to take. A loop will continually redisplay the menu until the user selects Quit (number 4) to terminate the program. Notes: The conversion methods should take the value to be converted as a parameter and return a result. They should not do any input or display the result. Add additional methods if they will help structure the program. Q1.9 Write a one-class program to determine if a long integer is a palindrome (i.e., represents the same value when reversed, for example 123454321). Q1.10 The example palindrome program seen in the preceding notes includes a tidyString method to remove spaces and make all characters lower case before checking whether a sentence is a palindrome. However, many example palindromes also include punctuation and spaces, for example “Neil, a trap! Sid is part alien!”. Modify the example palindrome program to remove the punctuation and spaces and compare any string. Q1.11 Write a one-class program with suitable methods to read a text file character by character and count how frequently each character occurs. Hints: You will need to use the FileInput class, which is used in a similar way to the Input class. See the notes on using FileInput. The FileInput .class file needs to be in the same directory as the program you are working on. Copy FileInput.class to all directories containing programs that need to use it. Q1.12 Write a program using methods that copies and reverses a text file (i.e., so that the destination file contains a backwards copy of the original file contents). This program will need both the FileInput and FileOutput classes (described in separate notes). Q1.13 Further modify the palindrome program to read a file containing strings (one per line) and checking whether each string is a palindrome. The palindromes found should be written to a separate output file. Note, do a Google search to find example palindromes. Q1.14 Write a program using methods to display your name, or any other message, in the middle of a line 80 characters wide. COMP0004 Notes and Exercises 1 -4- Q1.15 Write a program that uses a recursive method to calculate the product of a sequence of numbers speciﬁed by the user. For example, if the user speciﬁes 4 to 8, the method calculates 4*5*6*7*8. Any range can be used, including the use of negative numbers, and the program must correctly determine the values in the range. Note that Java does not support ranges directly like Groovy does. Q1.16  Write a method that takes two character array parameters and returns true if both arrays contain the same characters but not necessarily in the same order. Note, character arrays are of type char[]. Harder Questions You may have previously written C programs to answer these questions, try them again in Java and compare your code with your C version. Q1.17 Write a method to test if an integer of type long is a prime number. The method should return a boolean value. Test your method by writing a test one-class program that reads an integer typed at the keyboard and states whether the integer was prime. Next, using your prime method, write a program that finds all the prime numbers that can be represented by an integer of type long. Notes: This is not quite as easy as it might appear, especially if you want the program to produce results quickly. Search the web for information about prime numbers and algorithms for finding them - there are some excellent web sites. Q1.18 Write a program that reads an integer between 0 and 999 and \"verbalises it\". For example, if the program is given 123 it would display \"one hundred and twenty three\". Hint: Write methods to deal with ranges of numbers, such as single digits between \"zero\" and \"nine\", numbers between 10 and 19 and so on. Challenges Q1.19 Write a program that reads a text ﬁle containing Java source code and checks that there is a matching number of opening and closing braces (curly brackets). Beware of braces appearing in comments, or in character literals (strings) and constants. Q1.20 Redo some of the earlier questions using one or more different Object-Oriented programming languages. In particular look at Python, Javascript, C#, or C++. You will find plenty of information about these languages on the web. COMP0004 Object-Oriented Programming Programming Exercises 2 Aim to complete as many questions as you can by the end of January Purpose: Writing more Java programs to get familiar with the core language. Goal: Complete as many of the exercise questions as you can. If you are keeping up, you need to do at least the core questions. The additional questions are more challenging and are designed to stretch the more confident programmers. If you can\\'t do them now, be prepared to come back and try them later on. You must complete the core questions and get them reviewed in a lab session. Feedback: It is important that you get feedback on your exercise answers so that you know they are correct, that you are not making common mistakes, that the program code is properly presented and that you are confident you have solved the problem properly. To do this, get your answers reviewed by a TA during a lab session. See the additional notes on the COMP0004 Moodle site about using Java, and classes Input, FileInput and FileOutput.\\nA: It looks like you have a comprehensive set of exercises for your COMP0004 Object-Oriented Programming course. Let\\'s tackle some of the core questions by giving you structured guidance to ensure you can accomplish these tasks effectively. I\\'ll provide solutions or guidance for a few of these questions to help you get started.\\n\\n### Core Questions\\n\\n#### Q1.1 Write a program that inputs a sequence of Strings until the word \"stop\" is entered.\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.Scanner;\\n\\npublic class StringSequence {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\\n        String input;\\n\\n        System.out.println(\"Enter strings, type \\'stop\\' to end.\");\\n        while (true) {\\n            input = scanner.nextLine();\\n            if (\"stop\".equals(input)) {\\n                break; // Exit the loop if the input is \"stop\"\\n            }\\n            // Process the input\\n            System.out.println(\"You entered: \" + input);\\n        }\\n        scanner.close();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### Q1.2 Write a program to input 10 doubles and compute the average.\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.Scanner;\\n\\npublic class AverageCalculator {\\n    private static final int NUM_DOUBLES = 10;\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        double[] numbers = new double[NUM_DOUBLES];\\n        inputDoubles(numbers);\\n        double average = computeAverage(numbers);\\n        System.out.println(\"Average: \" + average);\\n    }\\n\\n    private static void inputDoubles(double[] numbers) {\\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\\n        System.out.println(\"Enter 10 double values:\");\\n        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {\\n            numbers[i] = scanner.nextDouble();\\n        }\\n        scanner.close();\\n    }\\n\\n    private static double computeAverage(double[] numbers) {\\n        double sum = 0;\\n        for (double num : numbers) {\\n            sum += num;\\n        }\\n        return sum / numbers.length;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### Q1.3 Store 10 words in an ArrayList and display them in reverse sorted order.\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\nimport java.util.Collections;\\nimport java.util.Scanner;\\n\\npublic class WordSorter {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        ArrayList<String> words = new ArrayList<>();\\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\\n\\n        System.out.println(\"Enter 10 words:\");\\n        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\\n            words.add(scanner.next());\\n        }\\n        scanner.close();\\n\\n        Collections.sort(words, Collections.reverseOrder());\\n        System.out.println(\"Words in reverse sorted order: \" + words);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### Q1.4 Generate 10,000 random doubles and find the largest, smallest, and average.\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.Random;\\n\\npublic class RandomDoubles {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        Random random = new Random();\\n        final int count = 10000;\\n        double min = Double.MAX_VALUE;\\n        double max = Double.MIN_VALUE;\\n        double sum = 0.0;\\n\\n        for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {\\n            double number = random.nextDouble() * 2 - 1; // Generates between -1 and +1\\n            sum += number;\\n            if (number < min) min = number;\\n            if (number > max) max = number;\\n        }\\n\\n        double average = sum / count;\\n\\n        System.out.println(\"Minimum: \" + min);\\n        System.out.println(\"Maximum: \" + max);\\n        System.out.println(\"Average: \" + average);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nAs you progress, ensure you test each piece of code rigorously and understand the logic behind each line. Additionally, make use of IntelliJ IDEA\\'s handy features, such as debuggers and code inspections, to streamline your development process. Don\\'t hesitate to seek feedback during lab sessions, as it\\'s a valuable way to learn and improve your programming skills.\\n\\nIf you need further assistance with any specific question, let me know!', 'Q: Write a program to read in a text file and output the number of characters, words and lines it contains. Spaces, tabs, newlines and similar characters should all be counted as characters. Words should contain only a-z and A-Z. Hyphens, quotes, digits and any other characters are not part of a word. This means, for example, that words hyphenated like ‘on-time’ are treated as two words.\\nA: To solve this problem, you can write a Java program that reads a text file and calculates the number of characters, words, and lines according to the specified rules. Below is an example implementation of such a program:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.BufferedReader;\\nimport java.io.FileReader;\\nimport java.io.IOException;\\nimport java.util.regex.Pattern;\\n\\npublic class FileStats {\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        if (args.length != 1) {\\n            System.out.println(\"Usage: java FileStats <filename>\");\\n            return;\\n        }\\n\\n        String filename = args[0];\\n        \\n        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename))) {\\n            int charCount = 0;\\n            int wordCount = 0;\\n            int lineCount = 0;\\n            String line;\\n            \\n            // Define a regular expression pattern for words consisting of only a-z, A-Z\\n            Pattern wordPattern = Pattern.compile(\"[a-zA-Z]+\");\\n\\n            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\\n                lineCount++;\\n                charCount += line.length() + 1; // +1 for the newline character\\n\\n                // Use regex to extract words\\n                String[] words = wordPattern.split(line);\\n                \\n                // Count valid words\\n                wordCount += words.length;\\n            }\\n\\n            // Output the results\\n            System.out.println(\"Characters: \" + charCount);\\n            System.out.println(\"Words: \" + wordCount);\\n            System.out.println(\"Lines: \" + lineCount);\\n        } catch (IOException e) {\\n            System.err.println(\"An error occurred: \" + e.getMessage());\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation:\\n\\n1. **Input Handling**:\\n   - The program reads the filename from the command line arguments. It ensures that exactly one argument (the filename) is passed.\\n\\n2. **BufferedReader**:\\n   - A `BufferedReader` is used to efficiently read the text file line-by-line.\\n\\n3. **Counting**:\\n   - **Characters**: Each line\\'s length is added to the character count, and the newline character (`\\\\n`) is considered as well.\\n   - **Words**: A regular expression pattern (`\"[a-zA-Z]+\"`) is used to identify words containing only alphabetic characters. The `split` method is applied, effectively counting valid words in the line.\\n   - **Lines**: Each iteration of reading a line increments the line count.\\n\\n4. **Handling I/O Exceptions**:\\n   - The program catches and reports any `IOException` that might occur during file operations.\\n\\n5. **Output**:\\n   - The counts of characters, words, and lines are printed to the console.\\n\\nBefore running this program, make sure that the Java development environment is set up on your machine and that the file you\\'re analyzing exists and is accessible. You execute the program from the command line by passing the path of the file to be analyzed, like this:\\n\\n```shell\\njava FileStats path/to/your/file.txt\\n```\\n\\nEnsure the file path is correctly provided, so the program can access and process the file without issues.', 'Q: Write a program to read in a day, month and year, create an object to represent the date, and output the result as a formatted string (e.g., 2022-01-01). Use a class in the Java class library to represent and store the date. Hint: There is a Date class but this is not what you want. Instead, look at the JavaDoc documentation for the Calendar class (e.g., Calendar.getInstance or Calendar.set), and also the DateFormat class for formatting dates to display. The JavaDoc explains how to use these classes, with some examples. Q3 a. The Java Library class BigDecimal provides ‘immutable, arbitrary-precision signed decimal numbers’, or in other words numbers that can be as large as you want (subject to available memory) and not limited to 32 or 64 bit representations. Write a program to calculate factorial numbers of any size (or as big as can fit in memory). b. Modify your prime number program from Exercises 1 Q17 to use BigDecimal rather than long. - - 1 DEPARTMENT OF COMPUTER SCIENCE Exercises  2 4. You are probably familiar with a sliding block puzzle like the one illustrated below, where you have to slide the numbered blocks into order: Determine a data structure to represent a sliding block puzzle and a recursive algorithm that will find the sequence of moves needed to slide the blocks into order from any starting position. Write a Java program to implement this. Note, use a text-based display, you don’t need to display a graphical version. 5. The Java library class HashMap implements a dictionary or map class, that maps keys to values. For example, (key: ‘blue’ value: 123) maps the String ‘blue’ to the integer 123. The type of a HashMap to store the example would be declared as HashMap<String,Integer>, note the syntax and that you have to specify the key and value types. The JavaDoc for HashMap gives the methods to use a map and further information. Write a Java program that uses a HashMap to implement a word dictionary, mapping words to their meanings (HashMap<String,String>). It should be possible to add words and meanings, get the meaning for a word, and any other operations you think necessary. Input and Output can be via the terminal, but words and meanings can be stored in files. 6. Consider a program that reads a Java source file (.java file) and verifies that the opening and closing braces (curly brackets) are correctly paired and nested. Beware of braces appearing in comments and string literals. i) Write a basic one-class version of the program just using methods, variables, loops, etc. You can use the FileInput class to read the file, it does not count as the one-class. ii) Write a version with several classes, one of which is a class BracePair to represent a matched pair of opening and closing braces. As braces can be nested, BracePair should also have an ArrayList<BracePair> of nested BracePairs, allowing zero of more nested pairs of braces to be recorded. As the program runs it builds a simple tree-like structure of BracePair objects representing the structure of the source code in terms of braces. If a complete tree can be built then it means that the braces are correct in the source code, otherwise the program should stop when it first finds that the braces are incorrect Add additional functionality using the BracePair tree structure to generate a report on the level of nesting of braces, for example the number of pairs nested at depth one, two, etc., the deepest level of nesting, and the pair with the most nested pairs. - - 2 COMP0004 -1- COMP0004 Object-Oriented Programming Programming Exercises 3 Aim to complete as many questions as you can by the end of Reading Week Purpose: Writing Java classes. Goal: Complete as many of the exercise questions as you can. If you are keeping up, you need to do at least the core questions. The additional questions are more challenging and are designed to stretch the more confident programmers. If you can\\'t do them now, be prepared to come back and try them later on. You must complete the core questions and get them reviewed in a lab session. Feedback: It is important that you get feedback on your exercise answers so that you know they are correct, that you are not making common mistakes, that the program code is properly presented and that you are confident you have solved the problem properly. To do this, get your answers reviewed by a TA during a lab session. See the additional notes on the COMP0004 Moodle site about using Java, and classes Input, FileInput and FileOutput. Q1. a) Write a class AddressBookEntry to represent an entry in an address book. An object of the class should store the name, phone number and email address for one person. The class should have a constructor to initialise a new object to represent a specific person, and getter methods to access each piece of information: public AddressBookEntry(String name, String phone, String email); public String getName(); public String getPhone(); public String getEmail(); The class must not do any input or output. The information needed to represent a person entry is passed via the constructor. The instance variables storing the data must be private. b) Next write a class AddressBook, that uses a private ArrayList<AddressBookEntry> instance variable to store entries in an address book. The class should include methods to add, remove and search for entries. Note again, this class should not do any input or output. c) Write a class with a main method that creates an address book and allows it to be used by adding, removing and searching for entries. This class does the input and output, as well as the main method. Think carefully about the public methods and their parameters needed by all three classes. What is are the correct methods for the abstractions that the classes represent? All instance variables should be private, so that data is accessed only by the object it belongs to. d) class AddressBookEntry can be rewritten as a Java record declaration, as it only creates immutable data objects. Start a new project and write record AddressBookEntry in Exercises  3 -2- Java. Hint: This will be one line of code! The methods needed by the record class are automatically generated. e) Now copy and paste the other classes into the new project and modify them to use record AddressBookEntry.\\nA: Let\\'s break down the exercise into distinct parts and tackle each one step by step. You are dealing with a variety of tasks, so starting with the initial exercises makes sense, and we will proceed from there.\\n\\n### Exercise Q1\\n\\n#### Part a: AddressBookEntry Class\\n\\nThis class will represent an entry in an address book with fields for `name`, `phone number`, and `email address`.\\n\\n```java\\npublic class AddressBookEntry {\\n    private String name;\\n    private String phone;\\n    private String email;\\n\\n    public AddressBookEntry(String name, String phone, String email) {\\n        this.name = name;\\n        this.phone = phone;\\n        this.email = email;\\n    }\\n\\n    public String getName() {\\n        return name;\\n    }\\n\\n    public String getPhone() {\\n        return phone;\\n    }\\n\\n    public String getEmail() {\\n        return email;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### Part b: AddressBook Class\\n\\nThis class will manage multiple `AddressBookEntry` objects using an `ArrayList`.\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\nimport java.util.List;\\n\\npublic class AddressBook {\\n    private List<AddressBookEntry> entries;\\n\\n    public AddressBook() {\\n        this.entries = new ArrayList<>();\\n    }\\n\\n    public void addEntry(AddressBookEntry entry) {\\n        entries.add(entry);\\n    }\\n\\n    public boolean removeEntry(String name) {\\n        return entries.removeIf(entry -> entry.getName().equalsIgnoreCase(name));\\n    }\\n\\n    public AddressBookEntry searchEntry(String name) {\\n        for (AddressBookEntry entry : entries) {\\n            if (entry.getName().equalsIgnoreCase(name)) {\\n                return entry;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return null;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### Part c: Main Method Class\\n\\nThis class handles the user interaction and performs operations on the `AddressBook`.\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.Scanner;\\n\\npublic class AddressBookApp {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        AddressBook addressBook = new AddressBook();\\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\\n        \\n        while (true) {\\n            System.out.println(\"Choose an option: \");\\n            System.out.println(\"1: Add Entry\");\\n            System.out.println(\"2: Remove Entry\");\\n            System.out.println(\"3: Search Entry\");\\n            System.out.println(\"4: Exit\");\\n\\n            int choice = scanner.nextInt();\\n            scanner.nextLine();

Please go through these implementations step by step. If you have more specific questions or need help with additional exercises mentioned, feel free to ask!', 'Q: A Range represents a sequence, or range, of integers, for example 1 to 10, 3 to 15, or -6 to 3. Write a class Range in Java with the following methods: • a constructor public Range(int lower, int upper) The range includes all the integers from the lower limit to the upper limit inclusive. For example, the range 2 to 4 includes 2, 3 and 4. The lower limit must be lower than the upper limit otherwise the constructor will throw an exception. • A method int getLower() to return the lower limit. • A method int getUpper() to return the upper limit. • A method boolean contains(int n) that returns true if the parameter value n is in the range, false otherwise. • A method getValues() that returns an ArrayList<Integer> containing all the values in the range in order. Write a second class, with a main method, to use Range objects and confirm they work correctly. Note that your Range class should not do any input or output, or have a main method.\\nA: To implement the `Range` class as described, we\\'ll start by defining the class and its methods in Java. Here\\'s how you could write the `Range` class:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\n\\npublic class Range {\\n    private int lower;\\n    private int upper;\\n\\n    // Constructor\\n    public Range(int lower, int upper) {\\n        if (lower > upper) {\\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Lower limit must be lower than upper limit.\");\\n        }\\n        this.lower = lower;\\n        this.upper = upper;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to get the lower limit\\n    public int getLower() {\\n        return lower;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to get the upper limit\\n    public int getUpper() {\\n        return upper;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to check if n is within the range\\n    public boolean contains(int n) {\\n        return n >= lower && n <= upper;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to get all values in the range as an ArrayList\\n    public ArrayList<Integer> getValues() {\\n        ArrayList<Integer> values = new ArrayList<>();\\n        for (int i = lower; i <= upper; i++) {\\n            values.add(i);\\n        }\\n        return values;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nNext, let\\'s create a second class that will test the `Range` class and confirm it works correctly. This class will contain a `main` method where we instantiate `Range` objects and test their methods.\\n\\n```java\\npublic class RangeTest {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        // Test case 1: Normal range\\n        Range range1 = new Range(1, 10);\\n        System.out.println(\"Lower: \" + range1.getLower()); // Output: Lower: 1\\n        System.out.println(\"Upper: \" + range1.getUpper()); // Output: Upper: 10\\n        System.out.println(\"Contains 5: \" + range1.contains(5)); // Output: true\\n        System.out.println(\"Contains 15: \" + range1.contains(15)); // Output: false\\n        System.out.println(\"Values: \" + range1.getValues()); // Output: [1, 2, 3, ..., 10]\\n\\n        // Test case 2: Negative range\\n        Range range2 = new Range(-6, 3);\\n        System.out.println(\"Lower: \" + range2.getLower()); // Output: Lower: -6\\n        System.out.println(\"Upper: \" + range2.getUpper()); // Output: Upper: 3\\n        System.out.println(\"Contains 0: \" + range2.contains(0)); // Output: true\\n        System.out.println(\"Contains -7: \" + range2.contains(-7)); // Output: false\\n        System.out.println(\"Values: \" + range2.getValues()); // Output: [-6, -5, ..., 3]\\n\\n        // Test case 3: Exception for invalid range\\n        try {\\n            Range range3 = new Range(10, 5); // Should throw an exception\\n        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {\\n            System.out.println(e.getMessage()); // Output: Lower limit must be lower than upper limit.\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis `RangeTest` class will create several `Range` objects and call their methods to ensure they function as intended. You can run this Java program to see if everything works correctly. Be mindful of the exception that should be thrown for invalid ranges, such as when the lower limit is greater than the upper limit.', 'Q: Consider a table that shows temperature conversions from Celsius to Fahrenheit, like this: Temperature Conversion ---------------------- C   F      C   F      C   F      C   F      C   F 0   32     1   33     2   35     3   37     4   39 5   41     6   42     7   44     8   46     9   48 10  50     11  51     12  53     13  55     14  57 a) Write a class for generating temperature conversion tables for specified ranges of temperatures. An object of the class is created to represent a particular table, and then its methods called to generate the table contents. The object should store the generated table in a 2D ArrayList<String> data structure. Think of the class as a factory for creating temperature conversion table objects. The class should have the following methods: • a constructor that allows the Celsius temperature range to be specified (min and max temperature to be shown in the table). • a public method to set the centred table header, e.g., the label “Temperature Conversion” • a public method to specify the column headers, e.g., ‘C’ and ‘F’. • a public method to specify the number of columns. • a public method to specify the number of spaces between each column. • a private method to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit (F=C * 9/5 -32). Exercises  3 -3- • a public method to generate and format the table in the 2D ArrayList<String> representation. This ArrayList should be private to the class. • a public method to return a copy of the 2D ArrayList<String> representation of the table. Note the the object does not do any input or output. It does not print the table on the screen, it only generates the ArrayList representation. Write a second class that uses the table class to generate tables and display them. This class does the input and output, so that the user can specify the table to generate and then see it displayed on the screen. The class also has the main method. Hint: Wouldn’t it be convenient if you could use something like printf to help format the strings making up each line of the table? Maybe if you look at the JavaDoc for class String? Strategy: The table class is quite complex, so don’t attempt to write the complete version all in one go. Start with a basic version that maybe just prints out the Celsius and Fahrenheit values without any formatting. Then incrementally add one small feature after another moving forward step-by- step to the final version. b) Add additional features to your temperature conversion table class to allow different ways to display the table and more formatting options. Exercises  3 -4- Challenge Questions\\nA: To create a temperature conversion table class in Java, we can follow a structured approach, gradually building the class with increasing complexity and adding features. Here’s a detailed breakdown of how you can create the `TemperatureConversionTable` class and an accompanying class to display the table:\\n\\n### Step 1: Basic Class Structure\\n\\nFirst, we\\'ll create the `TemperatureConversionTable` class with fundamental features.\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\n\\npublic class TemperatureConversionTable {\\n    private int minTemp;\\n    private int maxTemp;\\n    private String tableHeader;\\n    private String colHeaderC;\\n    private String colHeaderF;\\n    private int numColumns;\\n    private int columnSpacing;\\n    private ArrayList<ArrayList<String>> tableData;\\n\\n    public TemperatureConversionTable(int minTemp, int maxTemp) {\\n        if (minTemp > maxTemp) {\\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"minTemp cannot be greater than maxTemp\");\\n        }\\n        this.minTemp = minTemp;\\n        this.maxTemp = maxTemp;\\n        this.tableData = new ArrayList<>();\\n    }\\n\\n    public void setTableHeader(String header) {\\n        this.tableHeader = header;\\n    }\\n\\n    public void setColumnHeaders(String colHeaderC, String colHeaderF) {\\n        this.colHeaderC = colHeaderC;\\n        this.colHeaderF = colHeaderF;\\n    }\\n\\n    public void setNumColumns(int numColumns) {\\n        if (numColumns <= 0) {\\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Number of columns must be positive\");\\n        }\\n        this.numColumns = numColumns;\\n    }\\n\\n    public void setColumnSpacing(int spacing) {\\n        if (spacing < 0) {\\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Column spacing cannot be negative\");\\n        }\\n        this.columnSpacing = spacing;\\n    }\\n\\n    private int convertCelsiusToFahrenheit(int celsius) {\\n        return (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32;\\n    }\\n\\n    public void generateTable() {\\n        tableData.clear(); // Clear existing data\\n\\n        ArrayList<String> headerRow = new ArrayList<>();\\n        headerRow.add(tableHeader);\\n        tableData.add(headerRow);\\n\\n        ArrayList<String> columnHeaders = new ArrayList<>();\\n        for (int i = 0; i < numColumns; i++) {\\n            columnHeaders.add(colHeaderC);\\n            columnHeaders.add(colHeaderF);\\n        }\\n        tableData.add(columnHeaders);\\n\\n        for (int celsius = minTemp; celsius <= maxTemp; celsius++) {\\n            if ((celsius - minTemp) % numColumns == 0) {\\n                tableData.add(new ArrayList<>());\\n            }\\n            int fahrenheit = convertCelsiusToFahrenheit(celsius);\\n            tableData\\n                .get(tableData.size() - 1)\\n                .add(String.format(\"%d  %d\", celsius, fahrenheit));\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    public ArrayList<ArrayList<String>> getTableData() {\\n        // Return a copy of the tableData to prevent modification\\n        ArrayList<ArrayList<String>> copy = new ArrayList<>();\\n        for (ArrayList<String> row : tableData) {\\n            copy.add(new ArrayList<>(row));\\n        }\\n        return copy;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Step 2: Class to Display and Handle User Input\\n\\nNow, let\\'s write another class that uses this conversion table to perform input/output.\\n\\n```java\\npublic class TemperatureTableApp {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        // Example usage\\n        TemperatureConversionTable table = new TemperatureConversionTable(0, 14);\\n        table.setTableHeader(\"Temperature Conversion\");\\n        table.setColumnHeaders(\"C\", \"F\");\\n        table.setNumColumns(5);\\n        table.setColumnSpacing(5);\\n\\n        // Generate the table data\\n        table.generateTable();\\n\\n        // Get the formatted table and print it\\n        ArrayList<ArrayList<String>> tableData = table.getTableData();\\n\\n        for (ArrayList<String> row : tableData) {\\n            for (String cell : row) {\\n                System.out.print(cell + \" \".repeat(table.getColumnSpacing()));\\n            }\\n            System.out.println();\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Step 3: Additional Features\\n\\nTo expand the table class with further formatting options:\\n- Add methods for different alignments (left, right, center).\\n- Offer different formatting styles for headers, columns, etc.\\n\\nExplore `String.format` and `printf` for advanced formatting.\\n\\n### Notes\\n- Ensure that the number of columns and spacing configurations allow the table to be formatted correctly.\\n- This setup doesn\\'t explicitly format spacing between columns in display code but allows flexibility.\\n- Consider exceptions for invalid input parameters.\\n\\nThis code provides a structured, object-oriented approach to creating and managing temperature conversion tables, allowing for flexibility in formatting and displaying conversion data.', 'Q: Look at this UML class icon: A CelestialBody is an object like a planet, star, moon. Objects of this class could be used to construct a model (data representation) of the solar system, using the associations shown outside the icon on the right. The icon shows various attributes (instance variables) and methods in UML style (looks like Java but not the same). a) Write a Java version of the class CelestialBody. Make your own assumptions about the method implementations. You can add or remove attributes and methods as you see fit, but make changes when you know you need them, not just to make lots of changes for things that might (or might not) be needed! b) Write the code (more classes) to implement a program to use your CelestialBody class. You will probably want to work on a) and b) in parallel. The program might read data from files to create the objects to represent the solar system, for example, and then display a representation of the solar system. If you are ambitious you might want to attempt a graphical display, otherwise using text. Exercises  3 -5- Q5. The Game of Greed This game specification comes from a programming exercise created by Tom Love for an OOPSLA-89 conference workshop. It is based on dice games that have been around for a lot longer and the real origin is probably lost in time. The game is known to be quite boring to actually play, but makes a very good small-scale design and programming exercise!! Greed is a dice game played between two or more players. The object of the game is to tally points from the dice rolls and be the first player to score 5,000 points. There are five dice in the game that are rolled from a cup. To enter the game, a player must score at least 300 points on the first roll of his or her turn; otherwise, the player is considered “bust”. If the player goes bust, he or she must wait their turn to roll again. If this first roll produces 300 or more points, then the player has the option of stopping and keeping the initial score or continuing. To continue, the player rolls only the dice that have not yet scored in this turn. A player may continue rolling until all the dice have scored or until they go bust. With the exception of the entry roll, a bust is when an individual roll produces no points. The player may stop and keep their score after any roll as long as they have not gone bust. If all the dice score on a single role, then the player can continue and roll all the dice again. When a player goes bust or opts to stop, the dice are passed to the next player for their turn. Each player keeps the running total of all the scores from their turns. The score for each dice roll is determined as follows: • Three of a kind (three dice all showing the same value) scores 100 times the face value (e.g, if three dice are showing 3, then 100 x 3). • But if the face value is one, then it is scored as 1,000 (e.g., there are three dice showing 1). • Single dice showing 1 or 5, score 100 and 50 points respectively. Finally, the winner is determined after a player collects a total score of 5,000 or more and all players have had an equal number of turns. If, for example, a player scores over 5,000 points, they may still lose if a subsequent player ends up with a greater final score. Examples (for first roll): i) Rolled 44446 = 400 points (three of a kind showing 4) with the option to roll the 4 & 6 again. ii) Rolled 11111 = 1000 + 100 + 100 = 1200 points (three of a kind, plus two 1s) with the option to role all five dice again, as all dice scored. iii) Rolled 12315 = 100 + 0 + 0 + 100 + 50 points Exercises  3 -6- with the option to roll the 2 & 3 again. Implement this game using classes and objects. It is up to you whether you want to include computer players or a user interface to allow human players (a terminal based interface is just fine). To better understand how the game is played, try playing it using real dice with some friends. Below is a class diagram showing one set of classes that might be used to implement the game. This is not the only way — ask yourself if the Game or Cup classes are needed. Also which class should really keep score and apply the rules? The association lines below are shown as bi- directional (no arrow heads), requiring decisions to be made on where the arrow heads should go. The open diamond is the aggregation annotation (collection of). -1- COMP0004 Object-Oriented Programming Programming Exercises 4 Purpose: More practice of using Java by working on editing and extending an already partly implemented program. Goal: Complete as many of the questions as you can. If you are keeping up, you need to do at least the core questions. The additional questions are more challenging and are designed to stretch the more confident programmers. If you can\\'t do them now, be prepared to come back and try them later on. You should complete at least the core questions and get them reviewed in a lab session. Feedback: It is important that you get feedback on your answers so that you know they are correct, that you are not making common mistakes, that the program code is properly presented and that you are confident you have solved the problem properly. To do this, get your answers reviewed by a TA during lab sessions. Getting Started These exercises require you to work with the example SimpleOrderSystem program. Create a project by getting the code from the GitHub repository: https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/COMP0004SimpleOrderSystem There is a video on Week 3 Moodle showing how to do this if you are not sure how. This is optional but strongly recommended: You should know how to use the Git version control system! Create and use a local git repository, so that you are making regular commits as you work on these exercises. Start by creating a local repository and adding the classes from Simple Order System as the first commit. Ideally you should also create a cloud repo on GitHub, so that you can push your local commits up to your cloud repo. See the Week 3 section on Moodle for links on getting started with Git. Exercise Questions Each of these questions involves working with, modifying and/or extending the SimpleOrderSystem application. Start by reading through the code so that you understand it. The SimpleOrderSystem application as downloaded from the Git repo is not meant to be a complete or finished application. It is code that is still being developed, with plenty of scope for improvement. It will compile and run but there is no guarantee that it is free from errors! If you find any, fix them!\\nA: To tackle this project, let\\'s first break down the task into parts as per your requirements:\\n\\n### Part a: Create the `CelestialBody` class:\\n\\nI\\'ll start by creating a basic version of the `CelestialBody` class with some attributes and methods based on common characteristics of celestial bodies. You can adjust these based on specific details from the UML diagram you have.\\n\\n```java\\n// CelestialBody.java\\npublic class CelestialBody {\\n    private String name;\\n    private double mass; // in kilograms\\n    private double radius; // in kilometers\\n    private double distanceFromSun; // in kilometers\\n\\n    public CelestialBody(String name, double mass, double radius, double distanceFromSun) {\\n        this.name = name;\\n        this.mass = mass;\\n        this.radius = radius;\\n        this.distanceFromSun = distanceFromSun;\\n    }\\n\\n    public String getName() {\\n        return name;\\n    }\\n\\n    public double getMass() {\\n        return mass;\\n    }\\n\\n    public double getRadius() {\\n        return radius;\\n    }\\n\\n    public double getDistanceFromSun() {\\n        return distanceFromSun;\\n    }\\n\\n    public double calculateSurfaceGravity() {\\n        final double G = 6.67430e-11; // Gravitational constant\\n        return (G * mass) / (radius * 1000 * radius * 1000); // radius must be converted to meters\\n    }\\n\\n    @Override\\n    public String toString() {\\n        return String.format(\"Celestial Body: %s, Mass: %.2e kg, Radius: %.2f km, Distance from Sun: %.2f km\",\\n                name, mass, radius, distanceFromSun);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Part b: Create a simple program that uses the `CelestialBody` class:\\n\\nI\\'ll create additional classes and a main class to demonstrate usage of the `CelestialBody` class.\\n\\n```java\\n// SolarSystem.java\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\nimport java.util.List;\\n\\npublic class SolarSystem {\\n    private List<CelestialBody> celestialBodies;\\n\\n    public SolarSystem() {\\n        celestialBodies = new ArrayList<>();\\n    }\\n\\n    public void addCelestialBody(CelestialBody body) {\\n        celestialBodies.add(body);\\n    }\\n\\n    public void displayCelestialBodies() {\\n        for (CelestialBody body : celestialBodies) {\\n            System.out.println(body);\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```java\\n// Main.java\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        SolarSystem solarSystem = new SolarSystem();\\n\\n        // Adding some celestial bodies to the solar system\\n        CelestialBody earth = new CelestialBody(\"Earth\", 5.972e24, 6371, 149.6e6);\\n        CelestialBody mars = new CelestialBody(\"Mars\", 6.39e23, 3389.5, 227.9e6);\\n        CelestialBody sun = new CelestialBody(\"Sun\", 1.989e30, 695700, 0);\\n\\n        solarSystem.addCelestialBody(earth);\\n        solarSystem.addCelestialBody(mars);\\n        solarSystem.addCelestialBody(sun);\\n\\n        // Display the details of celestial bodies\\n        solarSystem.displayCelestialBodies();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Implementing the Game of Greed:\\n\\nFor the second part of your task related to the \"Game of Greed,\" a basic structure can include classes such as `Player`, `Dice`, and `Game`. Below is a simple text-based version.\\n\\n```java\\n// Dice.java\\npublic class Dice {\\n    private int value;\\n\\n    public Dice() {\\n        roll();\\n    }\\n\\n    public void roll() {\\n        value = (int) (Math.random() * 6) + 1;\\n    }\\n\\n    public int getValue() {\\n        return value;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```java\\n// Player.java\\npublic class Player {\\n    private String name;\\n    private int score;\\n\\n    public Player(String name) {\\n        this.name = name;\\n        this.score = 0;\\n    }\\n\\n    public String getName() {\\n        return name;\\n    }\\n\\n    public int getScore() {\\n        return score;\\n    }\\n\\n    public void addScore(int points) {\\n        score += points;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n```java\\n// Game.java\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\nimport java.util.List;\\nimport java.util.Scanner;\\n\\npublic class Game {\\n    private List<Player> players;\\n    private Dice[] dice;\\n    private static final int WINNING_SCORE = 5000;\\n\\n    public Game() {\\n        players = new ArrayList<>();\\n        dice = new Dice[5];\\n        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\\n            dice[i] = new Dice();\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    public void addPlayer(String name) {\\n        players.add(new Player(name));\\n    }\\n\\n    public void play() {\\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\\n        boolean gameOver = false;\\n\\n        while (!gameOver) {\\n            for (Player player : players) {\\n                boolean continueRolling = true;\\n                int turnScore = 0;\\n                \\n                System.out.println(player.getName() + \"\\'s turn:\");\\n                System.out.println(\"Rolling the dice...\");\\n                \\n                // Roll all five dice\\n                for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\\n                    dice[i].roll();\\n                    System.out.print(dice[i].getValue() + \" \");\\n                }\\n                System.out.println();\\n\\n                // Calculate the score\\n                // Simplified scoring rule for three of a kind\\n                int[] counts = new int[6];\\n                for (Dice d : dice) {\\n                    counts[d.getValue() - 1]++;\\n                }\\n\\n                for (int i = 0; i < counts.length; i++) {\\n                    if (counts[i] >= 3) {\\n                        turnScore += (i == 0) ? 1000 : (i + 1) * 100;\\n                    } else if (i == 0) {\\n                        turnScore += 100 * counts[i];\\n                    } else if (i == 4) {\\n                        turnScore += 50 * counts[i];\\n                    }\\n                }\\n\\n                if (turnScore >= 300) {\\n                    player.addScore(turnScore);\\n                    System.out.println(player.getName() + \" scored: \" + turnScore + \" points\");\\n                    System.out.println(player.getName() + \"\\'s total score: \" + player.getScore());\\n                    \\n                    // Check if the player has won\\n                    if (player.getScore() >= WINNING_SCORE) {\\n                        System.out.println(player.getName() + \" has won the game!\");\\n                        gameOver = true;\\n                        break;\\n                    }\\n                } else {\\n                    System.out.println(player.getName() + \" went bust!\");\\n                }\\n\\n                // Ask if player wishes to continue rolling (simplified)\\n                System.out.println(\"Do you want to roll again?

You can further refine these by implementing more detailed rules, error handling, and user prompts.', 'Q: Add a command to display the total value of all orders for all customers. In class SimpleOrderSystem you will need to add a menu item, and you might add a method called overallTotal that will be called from the doOption method. The overallTotal method could iterate through each customer object, from the list in SimpleOrderSystem, adding up their total for all their orders. Hint: But you have read through all the code to see what is already there haven’t you? UCL COMPUTER SCIENCE Exercises 4 -2- To avoid having to enter example data manually every time you run the code to test it, add a method in class SimpleOrderSystem, where the main method is, to add example data by creating objects and calling methods.\\nA: To implement the command that displays the total value of all orders for all customers, you\\'ll need to make the following modifications to your `SimpleOrderSystem` class. This will likely involve iterating through a list of customers and summing up the total value of their orders. I will guide you step-by-step on how this can be achieved:\\n\\n### Step-by-step Implementation\\n\\n1. **Add a Menu Option**: Include a new menu item for displaying the total value of all orders.\\n\\n2. **Implement the `overallTotal` Method**: This method will iterate through each customer and add up their total order values.\\n\\n3. **Add Example Data**: Create a method to add example data, making it easier to test your implementation.\\n\\n### Example Code\\n\\nHere\\'s a general idea of how your `SimpleOrderSystem` class might be structured, including these new features:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\nimport java.util.List;\\nimport java.util.Scanner;\\n\\npublic class SimpleOrderSystem {\\n    \\n    private List<Customer> customers;\\n\\n    public SimpleOrderSystem() {\\n        this.customers = new ArrayList<>();\\n        addExampleData();  // Populate with example data for testing\\n    }\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        SimpleOrderSystem sos = new SimpleOrderSystem();\\n        sos.runMenu();\\n    }\\n\\n    public void runMenu() {\\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\\n        boolean exit = false;\\n\\n        while (!exit) {\\n            System.out.println(\"1.

Adjust field names and method signatures accordingly if they differ from these examples.', 'Q: A Customer’s postcode needs to be stored separately from their address (e.g., number, street, town). Modify the Customer class and any other methods in other classes to support this.\\nA: To separate a customer\\'s postcode from their address in the `Customer` class, you\\'ll need to update the class by adding a new field for the postcode. Here’s a step-by-step guide on how you can modify the `Customer` class and any related methods:\\n\\n### Step 1: Update the Customer Class\\n\\nSuppose your initial `Customer` class looks like this:\\n\\n```java\\npublic class Customer {\\n    private String name;\\n    private String address; // Initially containing both address and postcode\\n\\n    // Constructor, getters, and setters\\n    public Customer(String name, String address) {\\n        this.name = name;\\n        this.address = address;\\n    }\\n\\n    public String getName() {\\n        return name;\\n    }\\n\\n    public void setName(String name) {\\n        this.name = name;\\n    }\\n\\n    public String getAddress() {\\n        return address;\\n    }\\n\\n    public void setAddress(String address) {\\n        this.address = address;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### Modify the Class to Include a Separate Postcode\\n\\n1. Add a new field called `postcode`.\\n2. Update the constructor to accept the postcode as a parameter.\\n3. Update the getters and setters for the new field.\\n\\n```java\\npublic class Customer {\\n    private String name;\\n    private String address; // Without postcode\\n    private String postcode;\\n\\n    // Updated constructor\\n    public Customer(String name, String address, String postcode) {\\n        this.name = name;\\n        this.address = address;\\n        this.postcode = postcode;\\n    }\\n\\n    public String getName() {\\n        return name;\\n    }\\n\\n    public void setName(String name) {\\n        this.name = name;\\n    }\\n\\n    public String getAddress() {\\n        return address;\\n    }\\n\\n    public void setAddress(String address) {\\n        this.address = address;\\n    }\\n\\n    public String getPostcode() {\\n        return postcode;\\n    }\\n\\n    public void setPostcode(String postcode) {\\n        this.postcode = postcode;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Step 2: Update Methods in Other Classes\\n\\nIf you have other methods or classes that interact with the `Customer` class, you\\'ll need to adjust them to handle the address and postcode separately. For instance:\\n\\n#### Example Method in Another Class\\n\\nSuppose you have a method that prints customer details:\\n\\n```java\\npublic void printCustomerDetails(Customer customer) {\\n    System.out.println(\"Name: \" + customer.getName());\\n    System.out.println(\"Address: \" + customer.getAddress()); // Previously contains postcode\\n    System.out.println(\"Postcode: \" + customer.getPostcode()); // New line for postcode\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Step 3: Update Object Creation\\n\\nYou\\'ll also need to update any instance creation of `Customer` to provide the postcode separately:\\n\\n```java\\nCustomer customer = new Customer(\"John Doe\", \"123 Main St, Springfield\", \"12345\");\\n```\\n\\nBy following these steps, the `Customer` class is now capable of storing the postcode separately from the other address details, making the design more modular and the data management clearer.', 'Q: Turn class Product into an abstract class and provide two or more subclasses for specific kinds of product. The method getDescription should be made abstract and the instance variable description removed from Product. Each subclass should support the common set of methods inherited from class Product, override the getDescription method, and can add additional information. For example, you might have a Book class that adds title, author, publication date, etc., with getDescription returning a string containing the information in a suitable format. Think carefully about the constructors needed for each class. Update the rest of the program to support the addition of the subclasses. Note, where possible the code in the program as a whole should still use variables of type Product and have an ArrayList<Product> to store the full collection of products. The subclass names only need to be used when objects are created in a new expression.\\nA: To achieve the goal of making `Product` an abstract class and creating subclasses for specific types of products, we\\'ll first define `Product` as an abstract class and implement the necessary subclasses. We\\'ll replace the `description` field with an abstract `getDescription` method in the `Product` class. Then, we\\'ll create specific subclasses, such as `Book` and `Electronics`, each with its own fields and implementation of `getDescription`.\\n\\nHere’s how you can implement this design:\\n\\n### Step 1: Define the Abstract `Product` Class\\n\\n```java\\npublic abstract class Product {\\n    private double price;\\n\\n    public Product(double price) {\\n        this.price = price;\\n    }\\n\\n    public double getPrice() {\\n        return price;\\n    }\\n\\n    public void setPrice(double price) {\\n        this.price = price;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses\\n    public abstract String getDescription();\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Step 2: Implement Subclasses\\n\\n#### Subclass `Book`\\n\\n```java\\npublic class Book extends Product {\\n    private String title;\\n    private String author;\\n    private String publicationDate;\\n\\n    public Book(double price, String title, String author, String publicationDate) {\\n        super(price);\\n        this.title = title;\\n        this.author = author;\\n        this.publicationDate = publicationDate;\\n    }\\n\\n    @Override\\n    public String getDescription() {\\n        return String.format(\"Book: %s by %s, Published: %s\", title, author, publicationDate);\\n    }\\n\\n    // Additional methods specific to Book\\n    public String getTitle() {\\n        return title;\\n    }\\n\\n    public String getAuthor() {\\n        return author;\\n    }\\n\\n    public String getPublicationDate() {\\n        return publicationDate;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### Subclass `Electronics`\\n\\n```java\\npublic class Electronics extends Product {\\n    private String brand;\\n    private String model;\\n    private String warrantyPeriod;\\n\\n    public Electronics(double price, String brand, String model, String warrantyPeriod) {\\n        super(price);\\n        this.brand = brand;\\n        this.model = model;\\n        this.warrantyPeriod = warrantyPeriod;\\n    }\\n\\n    @Override\\n    public String getDescription() {\\n        return String.format(\"Electronics: %s %s, Warranty: %s\", brand, model, warrantyPeriod);\\n    }\\n\\n    // Additional methods specific to Electronics\\n    public String getBrand() {\\n        return brand;\\n    }\\n\\n    public String getModel() {\\n        return model;\\n    }\\n\\n    public String getWarrantyPeriod() {\\n        return warrantyPeriod;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Step 3: Using the Abstract Class and Subclasses\\n\\nIn your main program, you can still use a list to store the products and manipulate them through the `Product` type:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\n\\npublic class ProductDemo {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        ArrayList<Product> products = new ArrayList<>();\\n\\n        // Create specific products\\n        Book book1 = new Book(29.99, \"Effective Java\", \"Joshua Bloch\", \"2018\");\\n        Electronics phone = new Electronics(499.99, \"Apple\", \"iPhone 13\", \"1 year\");\\n\\n        // Add products to the list\\n        products.add(book1);\\n        products.add(phone);\\n\\n        // Display product descriptions\\n        for (Product product : products) {\\n            System.out.println(product.getDescription() + \", Price: $\" + product.getPrice());\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation\\n\\n1. **Abstract Class**: The `Product` class is abstract and mandates that subclasses implement the `getDescription` method, which provides a flexible and extensible design.\\n\\n2. **Subclasses**: Each subclass, `Book` and `Electronics`, inherits from `Product` and implements the `getDescription` method with specific details relevant to the type of product.\\n\\n3. **Main Program**: You can store and manipulate all products in an `ArrayList<Product>`. This approach allows you to handle different types of products uniformly via the `Product` interface.\\n\\nThis design promotes the principles of encapsulation and polymorphism by allowing for new product types to be added easily in the future with minimal changes to the existing codebase.', 'Q: Add the ability to display a list of each order that includes a selected product. For each order, the customer name should also be displayed.\\nA: To achieve this task, we\\'ll need to iterate over the list of orders, filter them by the selected product, and then display each order along with the customer\\'s name. Here\\'s a general approach to how you might implement this in Java. This example assumes you have classes like `Order`, `Product`, and `Customer`.\\n\\nLet\\'s set up a basic example:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\nimport java.util.List;\\n\\n// Assume these are your basic classes.\\nclass Product {\\n    private String name;\\n    private String productId;\\n    \\n    // Constructor, getters, and setters\\n    public Product(String name, String productId) {\\n        this.name = name;\\n        this.productId = productId;\\n    }\\n\\n    public String getName() {\\n        return name;\\n    }\\n    \\n    public String getProductId() {\\n        return productId;\\n    }\\n    \\n    @Override\\n    public String toString() {\\n        return name;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass Customer {\\n    private String name;\\n    \\n    // Constructor, getters, and setters\\n    public Customer(String name) {\\n        this.name = name;\\n    }\\n\\n    public String getName() {\\n        return name;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass Order {\\n    private String orderId;\\n    private Customer customer;\\n    private List<Product> products;\\n    \\n    // Constructor, getters, and setters\\n    public Order(String orderId, Customer customer, List<Product> products) {\\n        this.orderId = orderId;\\n        this.customer = customer;\\n        this.products = products;\\n    }\\n\\n    public Customer getCustomer() {\\n        return customer;\\n    }\\n\\n    public List<Product> getProducts() {\\n        return products;\\n    }\\n    \\n    @Override\\n    public String toString() {\\n        return \"Order ID: \" + orderId + \", Customer: \" + customer.getName();\\n    }\\n}\\n\\npublic class OrderManager {\\n    private List<Order> orders;\\n\\n    public OrderManager(List<Order> orders) {\\n        this.orders = orders;\\n    }\\n\\n    public void displayOrdersWithProduct(Product selectedProduct) {\\n        System.out.println(\"Orders containing product: \" + selectedProduct.getName());\\n        for (Order order : orders) {\\n            if (order.getProducts().contains(selectedProduct)) {\\n                System.out.println(order);\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        // Create some products\\n        Product apple = new Product(\"Apple\", \"P001\");\\n        Product banana = new Product(\"Banana\", \"P002\");\\n        \\n        // Create some customers\\n        Customer alice = new Customer(\"Alice\");\\n        Customer bob = new Customer(\"Bob\");\\n        \\n        // Create some orders\\n        List<Product> productsOrder1 = new ArrayList<>();\\n        productsOrder1.add(apple);\\n        productsOrder1.add(banana);\\n        \\n        List<Product> productsOrder2 = new ArrayList<>();\\n        productsOrder2.add(apple);\\n        \\n        Order order1 = new Order(\"O001\", alice, productsOrder1);\\n        Order order2 = new Order(\"O002\", bob, productsOrder2);\\n        \\n        // Add orders to a list\\n        List<Order> orders = new ArrayList<>();\\n        orders.add(order1);\\n        orders.add(order2);\\n\\n        // Create the order manager\\n        OrderManager orderManager = new OrderManager(orders);\\n        \\n        // Display orders containing a specific product\\n        orderManager.displayOrdersWithProduct(apple);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this example, the `OrderManager` class has the method `displayOrdersWithProduct` that takes a `Product` as an argument. It loops through each order, checks if the order contains the selected product, and prints the order details if it does.\\n\\n### Key Points:\\n- Use `List<Product>` to store products within each order.\\n- Use `List<Order>` to maintain all the orders in the `OrderManager`.\\n- The method `displayOrdersWithProduct` is responsible for filtering and displaying orders that contain the specified product along with customer details.\\n\\nThis setup assumes all entities (like products and customers) are correctly set up and associated with the orders as needed. You might need to adapt this example according to your specific application setup and requirements.', 'Q: Add the ability to load and save data to or from a text file. A representation of the value of each object can be a sequence of text lines in the file with a start and end marker. For example, class Book object values might be represented as: book:1 title author publication date end book:2 title author publication date end … and so on. Where one object links to other objects, for example a Customer has list of Orders, you will need to add some kind of identifier (e.g., an integer), to correctly connect the objects together. In the Book example, the first line of each book entry is denoted by the word book followed by the integer. When loading data first think of the order objects need to be created and make use of temporary collections if needed. b. (Challenge) Store the data in JSON format instead of just lines of text. Exercises 4 -3-\\nA: To tackle this exercise, we\\'ll start by implementing the functionality to load and save data using plain text files. Following that, we\\'ll move on to the more advanced challenge of employing JSON format for data storage. This example will focus on a `Book` class and assume each `Book` has a list of `Orders`. Here\\'s how you can approach this solution:\\n\\n### Part A: Using Plain Text Files\\n\\n#### Step 1: Define Your Classes\\n\\nLet\\'s define simple `Book` and `Order` classes with minimal attributes and methods for this example:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\nimport java.util.List;\\n\\nclass Order {\\n    private int orderId;\\n    private String orderDetail;\\n\\n    public Order(int orderId, String orderDetail) {\\n        this.orderId = orderId;\\n        this.orderDetail = orderDetail;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Getters and toString() method for saving/loading purposes\\n    public int getOrderId() {\\n        return orderId;\\n    }\\n\\n    @Override\\n    public String toString() {\\n        return orderId + \" \" + orderDetail;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass Book {\\n    private int bookId;\\n    private String title;\\n    private String author;\\n    private String publicationDate;\\n    private List<Order> orders;\\n\\n    public Book(int bookId, String title, String author, String publicationDate) {\\n        this.bookId = bookId;\\n        this.title = title;\\n        this.author = author;\\n        this.publicationDate = publicationDate;\\n        this.orders = new ArrayList<>();\\n    }\\n\\n    public void addOrder(Order order) {\\n        this.orders.add(order);\\n    }\\n\\n    // Getters and other necessary methods\\n\\n    @Override\\n    public String toString() {\\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\\n        sb.append(\"book:\").append(bookId).append(\"\\\\n\");\\n        sb.append(title).append(\"\\\\n\");\\n        sb.append(author).append(\"\\\\n\");\\n        sb.append(publicationDate).append(\"\\\\n\");\\n        for (Order order : orders) {\\n            sb.append(\"order:\").append(order.toString()).append(\"\\\\n\");\\n        }\\n        sb.append(\"end\\\\n\");\\n        return sb.toString();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### Step 2: Implement Saving and Loading Logic\\n\\nTo handle file operations, you can use `BufferedReader` and `BufferedWriter` classes for reading and writing files, respectively.\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.*;\\n\\npublic class BookDataHandler {\\n    public void saveBooksToFile(List<Book> books, String filename) throws IOException {\\n        try (BufferedWriter writer = new BufferedWriter(new FileWriter(filename))) {\\n            for (Book book : books) {\\n                writer.write(book.toString());\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    public List<Book> loadBooksFromFile(String filename) throws IOException {\\n        List<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();\\n        try (BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader(filename))) {\\n            String line;\\n            Book currentBook = null;\\n            while ((line = reader.readLine()) != null) {\\n                if (line.startsWith(\"book:\")) {\\n                    int bookId = Integer.parseInt(line.substring(5));\\n                    String title = reader.readLine();\\n                    String author = reader.readLine();\\n                    String publicationDate = reader.readLine();\\n                    currentBook = new Book(bookId, title, author, publicationDate);\\n                } else if (line.startsWith(\"order:\") && currentBook != null) {\\n                    String[] orderDetails = line.substring(6).split(\" \", 2);\\n                    int orderId = Integer.parseInt(orderDetails[0]);\\n                    String orderDetail = orderDetails[1];\\n                    currentBook.addOrder(new Order(orderId, orderDetail));\\n                } else if (line.equals(\"end\") && currentBook != null) {\\n                    books.add(currentBook);\\n                    currentBook = null;\\n                }\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return books;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Part B: Storing Data in JSON Format\\n\\nTo store data in JSON format, we can utilize a JSON library such as Jackson or Gson. Below is an example using Gson:\\n\\n#### Step 1: Add Gson Dependency\\n\\nIf you\\'re using Maven, add the following dependency to your `pom.xml`:\\n\\n```xml\\n<dependency>\\n    <groupId>com.google.code.gson</groupId>\\n    <artifactId>gson</artifactId>\\n    <version>2.8.9</version>\\n</dependency>\\n```\\n\\n#### Step 2: Implement JSON Serialization and Deserialization\\n\\n```java\\nimport com.google.gson.Gson;\\nimport com.google.gson.reflect.TypeToken;\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.lang.reflect.Type;\\n\\npublic class BookJsonHandler {\\n    private Gson gson = new Gson();\\n\\n    public void saveBooksToJsonFile(List<Book> books, String filename) throws IOException {\\n        try (Writer writer = new FileWriter(filename)) {\\n            gson.toJson(books, writer);\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    public List<Book> loadBooksFromJsonFile(String filename) throws IOException {\\n        try (Reader reader = new FileReader(filename)) {\\n            Type listType = new TypeToken<List<Book>>() {}.getType();\\n            return gson.fromJson(reader, listType);\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Usage Example\\n\\nHere\\'s how you might use these classes in a main program:\\n\\n```java\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        try {\\n            List<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();\\n            Book book1 = new Book(1, \"Title1\", \"Author1\", \"2022-01-01\");\\n            book1.addOrder(new Order(101, \"Order Detail A\"));\\n            books.add(book1);\\n\\n            BookJsonHandler jsonHandler = new BookJsonHandler();\\n            jsonHandler.saveBooksToJsonFile(books, \"books.json\");\\n\\n            List<Book> loadedBooks = jsonHandler.loadBooksFromJsonFile(\"books.json\");\\n            for (Book book : loadedBooks) {\\n                System.out.println(book);\\n            }\\n        } catch (IOException e) {\\n            e.printStackTrace();\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis solution demonstrates how to serialize and deserialize objects using both plain text and JSON formats. The JSON approach leverages the Gson library for a more structured and versatile data representation.', 'Q: Add the ability to display the list of all orders for a Customer, showing each item in the order. In this and other questions you will probably want to improve the user interface to make the program easier to use. For example, instead of asking the user to type in the Customer’s name you could provide a numbered list of names and let the user type in a number.\\nA: To implement the ability to display all orders for a `Customer` and improve the user interface, you can follow these steps. I\\'ll guide you through:\\n\\n1. **Data Structures**: Assume you have a `Customer` class and an `Order` class. Each `Order` contains a list of items.\\n\\n2. **Enhanced User Interface**: Instead of asking users to type in details like the customer\\'s name, provide a menu-driven option where users can select by entering a number.\\n\\n3. **Printing Orders**: Add a method to print all the orders of a customer with their associated items.\\n\\nHere’s a simple way to encode this in Java:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\nimport java.util.HashMap;\\nimport java.util.List;\\nimport java.util.Scanner;\\n\\nclass Customer {\\n    private String name;\\n    private List<Order> orders;\\n\\n    public Customer(String name) {\\n        this.name = name;\\n        this.orders = new ArrayList<>();\\n    }\\n\\n    public String getName() {\\n        return name;\\n    }\\n\\n    public List<Order> getOrders() {\\n        return orders;\\n    }\\n\\n    public void addOrder(Order order) {\\n        orders.add(order);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass Order {\\n    private List<String> items;\\n\\n    public Order(List<String> items) {\\n        this.items = items;\\n    }\\n\\n    public List<String> getItems() {\\n        return items;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\npublic class OrderManagementSystem {\\n    private static HashMap<Integer, Customer> customers = new HashMap<>();\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        // Sample data\\n        Customer customer1 = new Customer(\"John Doe\");\\n        customer1.addOrder(new Order(List.of(\"Item1\", \"Item2\")));\\n        customer1.addOrder(new Order(List.of(\"Item3\", \"Item4\")));\\n\\n        Customer customer2 = new Customer(\"Jane Smith\");\\n        customer2.addOrder(new Order(List.of(\"Item5\")));\\n\\n        customers.put(1, customer1);\\n        customers.put(2, customer2);\\n\\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\\n        boolean exit = false;\\n\\n        while (!exit) {\\n            System.out.println(\"Select a customer by number to display their orders:\");\\n\\n            // Display customer list\\n            customers.forEach((id, customer) -> \\n                System.out.println(id + \". \" + customer.getName()));\\n\\n            System.out.println(\"Enter the customer number (or 0 to exit): \");\\n            int choice = scanner.nextInt();\\n\\n            if (choice == 0) {\\n                exit = true;\\n            } else if (customers.containsKey(choice)) {\\n                displayCustomerOrders(customers.get(choice));\\n            } else {\\n                System.out.println(\"Invalid choice.

It displays a list of customers and allows users to pick one by number, then it displays all orders for the selected customer.\\n\\n### User Interface Improvements:\\n- A list of customers is displayed, which the user can select by number, reducing the chance of input error.\\n- The orders and their items are printed in a user-friendly format.\\n\\nThis setup provides a basic yet functional approach to managing and displaying orders associated with customers. Adjust the sample data or the order/item structure as necessary to fit the specifics of your application’s requirements.', \"Q: Some or all of classes Customer, LineItem, Order and Product could be replaced by Java records. It would be best to create a new copy of your project to work on, or a branch in your Git repo, to make sure you retain your existing code. Try to do this and assess whether using records is a better design choice.\\nA: Java records, introduced in Java 14 as a preview feature and made stable in Java 16, provide a concise way to create classes that are primarily used to store immutable data. Using records can simplify code by automatically providing implementations for `equals()`, `hashCode()`, `toString()`, and getter methods. \\n\\nWhen considering converting a traditional Java class into a record, assess whether the class primarily serves as a data holder. If so, it may be a candidate for a record. Here's how you might approach converting your classes to records and assessing their usage:\\n\\n### Converting Classes to Records\\n\\n1. **Identify Immutable Data Holders**: Classes that are essentially containers for data (having private final fields, simple constructors, and accessor methods) are ideal candidates for conversion to records.\\n\\n2. **Consider the Class Design**:\\n   - **Customer**: If the `Customer` class holds information such as name, ID, email, and these don't change once created, it can be a record.\\n   - **Product**: If the `Product` class holds data fields like ID, name, and price, and these are immutable, it can be a record.\\n   - **LineItem**: Typically holds references to `Product` and quantities, which may also be immutable, making it a good candidate for a record.\\n   - **Order**: If the `Order` class is immutable after creation (for example, it holds order ID, customer, list of line items, etc.), it can also be a record.\\n\\n3. **Example Transformation**:\\n    ```java\\n    // Original Customer class\\n    public class Customer {\\n        private final String id;\\n        private final String name;\\n        private final String email;\\n\\n        public Customer(String id, String name, String email) {\\n            this.id = id;\\n            this.name = name;\\n            this.email = email;\\n        }\\n\\n        public String getId() {\\n            return id;\\n        }\\n\\n        public String getName() {\\n            return name;\\n        }\\n\\n        public String getEmail() {\\n            return email;\\n        }\\n\\n        // equals(), hashCode(), toString() can also be here\\n    }\\n\\n    // Converted to a record\\n    public record Customer(String id, String name, String email) {}\\n    ```\\n\\n4. **Assessing the Benefit**:\\n   - **Simplicity**: Records reduce boilerplate code, keeping your classes clean and focused on their core purpose.\\n   - **Immutability**: Records enforce immutability, which can lead to easier-to-maintain and reason-about code.\\n   - **Pattern Matching**: Records can be used in switch expressions which make them more flexible in new Java features.\\n\\n### When Not to Use Records\\n\\n- **Behavioral Logic**: If your classes contain significant business logic or need mutable state, records are not suitable.\\n- **Inheritance**: Records cannot extend other classes (only interfaces), so if your design relies on class hierarchy, continue with traditional classes.\\n\\n### Practical Steps\\n\\n1. **Create a Branch**: Ensure you experiment in a branch or a copied project.\\n2. **Convert Classes**: Start converting identified classes to records and refactor usage accordingly.\\n3. **Testing**: Run unit tests to ensure behavior remains consistent post-conversion.\\n4. **Review**: After conversion, your code should be more concise. Ensure the design still aligns with your requirements, especially regarding mutability and business logic encapsulated within classes.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you’ll be able to determine if Java records are a beneficial design choice for parts of your project.\", 'Q: (Harder Challenge) Implement a graphical user interface using Java Swing to replace the command line interface.

Writing a Set Class A set data structure represents a mathematical set, which stores a collection of values of the same type with no duplicates. This exercise is about implementing set classes, making use of interfaces, COMP0004 Exercises 5 2 of 5 generics, an abstract class, inheritance, overridden methods and exceptions. The Java language features needed to implement these classes are covered in the lectures and other material on Moodle, but it would be a good idea to read up on them as well. The goal is to set up a framework that will support several classes providing different concrete set implementations. The framework structure is shown above. This framework is based on the principles used by the data structure classes in the standard Java libraries but is intended to illustrate a range of programming concepts rather than be a fully practical design for a real framework. The Iterable interface is defined in the standard Java class library and declares the iterator method, so that each value stored in a data structure can be accessed, or iterated, in sequence. Implementing the Iterable interface also allows the values stored in a data-structure object to be accessed in sequence using the enhanced for loop (for each), and using forEach with Streams. The MySet interface defines the common methods for all set classes. It is named MySet to avoid confusion with the Set class in the Java class Library, which you do not need to use at all. MySet extends the Iterable interface, remembering that one interface can extend another. A variable of type MySet can reference any set object of a class that implements MySet (or inherits the implements relationship). This enables ‘Programming to an Interface’, allowing code to be written using the MySet type without needing to be concerned about the exact type of set of objects it is working with at runtime. For these exercises you are given the code of a basic version of the MySet framework as a starting point, including one example set implementation called ArrayMySet. You will find this code in a GitHub repository at: https://github.com/UCLComputerScience/2025-COMP0004MySet Clone this repo into your working directory on your local machine and then load it into IDEA by creating a new project, or create a new project directly by cloning. Note that you cannot push to the repo, but you can connect it to your own GitHub repo if you create one and push to that. The MySet code uses generics so that the classes and interfaces are parameterised over the type of value held in a set. Hence, when declaring a variable of type MySet you would have: MySet<Integer> set; // Reference to a set of Integers. When you look at the MySet interface you will see that it declares the type parameter like this: public interface MySet<T extends Comparable<T>> extends Iterable<T> The <T extends Comparable<T>> means that the type T is constrained to be Comparable or a subtype of Comparable. Comparable is an interface that defines the compareTo method to compare the values of two objects (see the Javadoc for a full explanation). This constraint is necessary as the values held in a set must be comparable to ensure that there are no duplicates in the set. A set can only hold values of types that implement the Comparable interface, which include Integer, Double, String, or any class you write that implements Comparable. Some MySet methods are declared as throwing exceptions of type MySetException, and a default maximum size is imposed on all sets of 1000 values. A different maximum size can be specified when a set object is created. If an attempt is made to to create a set with size greater than the maximum size, or less than 1, an exception should be thrown. In addition, if adding a value to a set would cause it to exceed the maximum size an exception should be thrown. The AbstractMySet class is an abstract class that provides common methods to be inherited by concrete subclasses. This avoids duplicating the methods in the subclasses as they can just be defined once and inherited. In the code you get from GitHub you will see that a number of methods are included but are not complete. You will need to add the missing code. For example, the union COMP0004 Exercises 5 3 of 5 method is intended to find the set union between the set the method is called on and the set passed as a parameter. A new set containing the union is returned, with the new set object created using a Factory. A factory is a class that specialises in creating objects. The use of a factory avoids code having to name a specific concrete set class and decouples object creation from class naming. Factory is an example of a Design Pattern. Class MySetFactory implements a basic factory. When a program using sets is started, the MySetFactory is given the name of the set class (a String) that it will create objects of. The MySetFactory also implements the Singleton Pattern, meaning that only one instance object of the class can be created when the program is run (see the example code in the Main class included with the framework code). A complete example set implementation class, ArrayMySet, is provided that uses an ArrayList as the private internal data structure used to store the values in the set. A private nested (member) class is used to implement the Iterator interface to enable iteration of the set object. Don’t confuse Iterable with Iterator. Iterable defines the iterator method, while Iterator defines the next and hasNext methods. Note that class ArrayMySet throws exceptions but does not catch any of its own exceptions. A set throws exceptions, while code using a set catches any exceptions using try/catch blocks. Make sure you understand the point being made here. Core Questions The initial code can be obtained from the GitHub repo. This code will compile and run but won’t do anything useful until the missing method code is implemented. There are no guarantees that the code does not contain errors - check carefully! Do not change any of the public method names in the MySet interface or MySetFactory, or any of the parameter or return types. Also use the class names specified in the questions. The GitHub content includes a Main class that is intended to contain code that uses the classes and code that you write, to demonstrate that the code works correctly. As you answer the questions below you should extend the Main class with more methods to confirm the answers work. It will be important to keep the code in the Main class well-organised and properly written, don’t let it become a mess. If you feel that your Main class is getting too large and unfocussed, then split it into two or more smaller classes. For example, the code to confirm that Q5 works could be put into another class.\\nA: To tackle the challenge of developing a graphical user interface (GUI) for the MySet framework using JavaFX as a replacement for a command-line interface (CLI), here’s a structured approach you can follow. This process involves using JavaFX to demonstrate interactions with a MySet class (such as adding integers to a set, performing union operations, etc.) and showcasing some GUI elements to interact with the set via the GUI.\\n\\n### Prerequisites:\\n\\n1. **JavaFX Setup**: Ensure you have JavaFX set up in your environment. This typically involves downloading the JavaFX SDK and setting up your IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA) to use the JavaFX libraries.\\n2. **Clone MySet Framework**: Make sure you\\'ve cloned the MySet framework from the provided GitHub link, and understand the core components and functionalities you need to implement.\\n\\n### Step-by-Step Implementation:\\n\\n1. **JavaFX Basic Setup**: Start by setting up a basic JavaFX application structure.\\n   \\n   ```java\\n   import javafx.application.Application;\\n   import javafx.scene.Scene;\\n   import javafx.scene.control.Button;\\n   import javafx.scene.control.Label;\\n   import javafx.scene.control.TextField;\\n   import javafx.scene.layout.VBox;\\n   import javafx.stage.Stage;\\n\\n   public class MySetApp extends Application {\\n       @Override\\n       public void start(Stage primaryStage) {\\n           // Initialize components of the GUI\\n           Label infoLabel = new Label(\"Manage Your Set\");\\n           TextField inputField = new TextField();\\n           inputField.setPromptText(\"Enter a number to add to set\");\\n           \\n           Button addButton = new Button(\"Add to Set\");\\n           Button unionButton = new Button(\"Union with Another Set\");\\n           Label resultLabel = new Label();\\n           \\n           VBox layout = new VBox(10, infoLabel, inputField, addButton, unionButton, resultLabel);\\n           Scene scene = new Scene(layout, 400, 300);\\n           \\n           primaryStage.setTitle(\"MySet Manager\");\\n           primaryStage.setScene(scene);\\n           primaryStage.show();\\n       }\\n   \\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\\n           launch(args);\\n       }\\n   }\\n   ```\\n\\n2. **Integrate MySet Logic**: Modify the `MySetApp` to implement logic with the MySet framework. Assume you have a concrete class `ArrayMySet` that implements `MySet<T>`.\\n\\n   ```java\\n   import myset.MySet;  // assuming package name\\n   import myset.ArrayMySet;\\n   import myset.MySetException;\\n\\n   public class MySetApp extends Application {\\n\\n       private MySet<Integer> mySet = new ArrayMySet<>();\\n\\n       @Override\\n       public void start(Stage primaryStage) {\\n           Label infoLabel = new Label(\"Manage Your Set\");\\n           TextField inputField = new TextField();\\n           inputField.setPromptText(\"Enter a number to add to set\");\\n           \\n           Button addButton = new Button(\"Add to Set\");\\n           Button unionButton = new Button(\"Union with Another Set\");\\n           Label resultLabel = new Label();\\n           \\n           addButton.setOnAction(e -> {\\n               String text = inputField.getText();\\n               try {\\n                   int number = Integer.parseInt(text);\\n                   mySet.add(number);\\n                   resultLabel.setText(\"Number added: \" + number);\\n               } catch (NumberFormatException nfe) {\\n                   resultLabel.setText(\"Please enter a valid number.\");\\n               } catch (MySetException mse) {\\n                   resultLabel.setText(\"Error: \" + mse.getMessage());\\n               } finally {\\n                   inputField.clear();\\n               }\\n           });\\n\\n           unionButton.setOnAction(e -> {\\n               // Here you would interact with or demonstrate union logic.\\n               resultLabel.setText(\"Performing union operation...\");\\n               // Example, just illustrating\\n               MySet<Integer> anotherSet = new ArrayMySet<>();\\n               try {\\n                   anotherSet.add(5); \\n                   MySet<Integer> resultSet = mySet.union(anotherSet);\\n                   resultLabel.setText(\"Union Done. Result set contains: \" + resultSet.toString());\\n               } catch (MySetException mse) {\\n                   resultLabel.setText(\"Error performing union: \" + mse.getMessage());\\n               }\\n           });\\n\\n           VBox layout = new VBox(10, infoLabel, inputField, addButton, unionButton, resultLabel);\\n           Scene scene = new Scene(layout, 400, 300);\\n       \\n           primaryStage.setTitle(\"MySet Manager\");\\n           primaryStage.setScene(scene);\\n           primaryStage.show();\\n       }\\n   \\n       public static void main(String[] args) {\\n           launch(args);\\n       }\\n   }\\n   ```\\n\\n3. **Extend the GUI Functionality**:\\n   - Add more buttons and logic for displaying set contents, checking if an element exists, clearing the set, or any other set-related operation.\\n   - Implement proper error handling using try-catch blocks around problematic operations (like invalid number formats or exceptions from set operations).\\n\\n4. **Optimization and Testing**:\\n   - Ensure your code adheres to good GUI practices, keeping the UI responsive by avoiding heavy computations directly on the JavaFX Application Thread.\\n   - Use Task or Service for operations that might take a considerable amount of time.\\n   - Test thoroughly to ensure all set operations work correctly via the GUI.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you\\'ll have a working JavaFX application that allows users to interact with a set data structure through a graphical interface. This approach not only meets the requirements of using JavaFX for GUI development but also showcases your ability to integrate complex logic into a UI.', 'Q: Complete the missing method bodies in class AbstractMySet, so that the code will compile and you can create and use ArrayMySet objects. The union, intersection and difference methods must all be implemented in the abstract class and inherited by the concrete subclasses. You should not implement the methods in the subclasses, or copy and paste the code into other classes.\\nA: To complete the missing method bodies in the `AbstractMySet` class, you need to ensure that it correctly implements the required set operations such as union, intersection, and difference. These methods should be defined in the abstract class and inherited by any subclasses that extend it, such as `ArrayMySet`.\\n\\nHere’s a potential implementation outline for `AbstractMySet`:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.HashSet;\\nimport java.util.Set;\\n\\nabstract class AbstractMySet<T> {\\n    protected Set<T> elements;\\n\\n    public AbstractMySet() {\\n        // Initialize the elements with a specific Set implementation, e.g., HashSet\\n        this.elements = new HashSet<>();\\n    }\\n\\n    // Abstract methods to be implemented by concrete subclasses\\n    public abstract boolean add(T element);\\n    public abstract boolean remove(T element);\\n    public abstract boolean contains(T element);\\n\\n    // Method to calculate the union of this set and another set\\n    public AbstractMySet<T> union(AbstractMySet<T> otherSet) {\\n        AbstractMySet<T> resultSet = createInstance();\\n        resultSet.elements.addAll(this.elements);\\n        resultSet.elements.addAll(otherSet.elements);\\n        return resultSet;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to calculate the intersection of this set and another set\\n    public AbstractMySet<T> intersection(AbstractMySet<T> otherSet) {\\n        AbstractMySet<T> resultSet = createInstance();\\n        resultSet.elements.addAll(this.elements);\\n        resultSet.elements.retainAll(otherSet.elements);\\n        return resultSet;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to calculate the difference of this set and another set\\n    public AbstractMySet<T> difference(AbstractMySet<T> otherSet) {\\n        AbstractMySet<T> resultSet = createInstance();\\n        resultSet.elements.addAll(this.elements);\\n        resultSet.elements.removeAll(otherSet.elements);\\n        return resultSet;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Helper method to create an instance of the subclass\\n    protected abstract AbstractMySet<T> createInstance();\\n}\\n\\n// Concrete implementation of AbstractMySet using an array-based approach\\nclass ArrayMySet<T> extends AbstractMySet<T> {\\n    \\n    @Override\\n    public boolean add(T element) {\\n        return elements.add(element);\\n    }\\n    \\n    @Override\\n    public boolean remove(T element) {\\n        return elements.remove(element);\\n    }\\n\\n    @Override\\n    public boolean contains(T element) {\\n        return elements.contains(element);\\n    }\\n\\n    @Override\\n    protected AbstractMySet<T> createInstance() {\\n        return new ArrayMySet<>();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation:\\n1. **AbstractMySet Class:** This abstract class includes a generic `Set<T>` named `elements` to store the set elements. It defines three abstract methods—`add`, `remove`, and `contains`—that must be implemented by any concrete subclass.\\n\\n2. **Union, Intersection, and Difference Methods:** \\n   - **Union** combines all elements from both sets.\\n   - **Intersection** retains only the elements present in both sets.\\n   - **Difference** retains only the elements present in the current set but not in the other.\\n\\n3. **createInstance Method:** This abstract method is introduced to allow the creation of a new instance of the concrete subclass. This way, the set operations can produce results of the same concrete type. \\n\\n4. **ArrayMySet Class:** This concrete subclass implements the abstract methods and uses the `HashSet` operations directly by delegating to the `elements` set.\\n\\nThis implementation ensures that the union, intersection, and difference operations are handled in `AbstractMySet`, and are automatically available to any subclass extending it, such as `ArrayMySet`.', 'Q: Add a method with the signature String toString() to the AbstractMySet class, that returns a string representation of the contents of a set in this style: { value1, value2, ... } Remember that toString() is a method declared in class Object (the superclass of all other classes), and can be overridden by any of your classes to specialise the way it represents an object’s value as a string. No code in any concrete subclasses should be changed, they can inherit the method you add to AbstractMySet. The example code in the Main class will be helpful for this question. COMP0004 Exercises 5 4 of 5\\nA: To implement the `toString()` method in the `AbstractMySet` class, you need to consider how the elements of the set are stored. Typically, sets in Java are collections, so we can assume the existence of methods to access the elements of the set, such as an iterator or a method to get the set elements in some form. Without the specific implementation of `AbstractMySet`, let\\'s assume it\\'s similar to Java\\'s `AbstractSet`, which usually has an `iterator()` method. \\n\\nHere\\'s how you can implement the `toString()` method for the `AbstractMySet` class:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.Iterator;\\n\\npublic abstract class AbstractMySet<E> {\\n\\n    // Other methods that AbstractMySet might contain\\n\\n    @Override\\n    public String toString() {\\n        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();\\n        sb.append(\"{\");\\n\\n        Iterator<E> iterator = this.iterator();\\n        while (iterator.hasNext()) {\\n            E element = iterator.next();\\n            sb.append(element);\\n            if (iterator.hasNext()) {\\n                sb.append(\", \");\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        sb.append(\"}\");\\n        return sb.toString();\\n    }\\n\\n    // Abstract method that concrete subclasses should implement\\n    public abstract Iterator<E> iterator();\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation\\n\\n1. **StringBuilder:** We use `StringBuilder` to efficiently build the string representation of the set. This avoids the creation of multiple unnecessary `String` objects.\\n\\n2. **Iterator:** We assume that `AbstractMySet` or its concrete implementation provides an `iterator()` method which returns an `Iterator` over the elements of the set. This is a common pattern in collection types.\\n\\n3. **Appending Elements:** We iterate through the elements using the iterator and append each element to the `StringBuilder`. The `toString()` method of each element is called implicitly.\\n\\n4. **Comma Handling:** After appending an element, if there are more elements to process, we append a comma and a space for separation.\\n\\n5. **Braces:** The entire string is wrapped in curly braces `{}`.\\n\\nThis method should work for any class that extends `AbstractMySet` and provides a proper `iterator()` method. This implementation will produce a string representation like `{ value1, value2, ... }`, where each `value` is the result of the `toString()` method of the respective set element.', 'Q: Implement a concrete class LinkedListMySet that uses a chain of linked list elements as its data structure. Do not use any linked list classes from the standard Java class libraries, you should implement the list code yourself. A linked list element class might look like this: private static class Element<E> { public E value; public Element<E> next; public Element(E value, Element<E> next) { this.value = value; this.next = next; } } This should be a nested class inside the LinkedListMySet class. As it is a private class providing infrastructure for the LinkedListMySet class the instance variables are public (think of a C struct). You might want to make them private and provide setters and getters.\\nA: Sure! Let\\'s implement a concrete class `LinkedListMySet` which uses a custom implementation of a singly linked list to store elements. We\\'ll use a nested static class `Element<E>` as a node in our linked list. To keep things simple, this set will not allow duplicate elements.\\n\\nFirst, let\\'s outline the general structure and some key methods you might want to include:\\n\\n1. **`add(E element)`** - Adds a new element to the set if it is not already present.\\n2. **`contains(E element)`** - Checks if an element is present in the set.\\n3. **`remove(E element)`** - Removes an element from the set if it exists.\\n4. **`size()`** - Returns the number of elements in the set.\\n5. **`isEmpty()`** - Checks if the set is empty.\\n\\nNow, let\\'s proceed with the implementation:\\n\\n```java\\npublic class LinkedListMySet<E> {\\n    private static class Element<E> {\\n        public E value;\\n        public Element<E> next;\\n\\n        public Element(E value, Element<E> next) {\\n            this.value = value;\\n            this.next = next;\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    private Element<E> head;\\n    private int size;\\n\\n    public LinkedListMySet() {\\n        this.head = null;\\n        this.size = 0;\\n    }\\n\\n    public boolean add(E element) {\\n        if (contains(element)) {\\n            return false; // Element already present, do not add\\n        }\\n        head = new Element<>(element, head);\\n        size++;\\n        return true;\\n    }\\n\\n    public boolean contains(E element) {\\n        Element<E> current = head;\\n        while (current != null) {\\n            if (current.value.equals(element)) {\\n                return true;\\n            }\\n            current = current.next;\\n        }\\n        return false;\\n    }\\n\\n    public boolean remove(E element) {\\n        if (head == null) {\\n            return false; // Empty list\\n        }\\n\\n        // Handle removal of head separately\\n        if (head.value.equals(element)) {\\n            head = head.next;\\n            size--;\\n            return true;\\n        }\\n\\n        Element<E> current = head;\\n        while (current.next != null) {\\n            if (current.next.value.equals(element)) {\\n                current.next = current.next.next;\\n                size--;\\n                return true;\\n            }\\n            current = current.next;\\n        }\\n        return false;\\n    }\\n\\n    public int size() {\\n        return size;\\n    }\\n\\n    public boolean isEmpty() {\\n        return size == 0;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Additional method to print the set (for demonstration purposes)\\n    public void printSet() {\\n        Element<E> current = head;\\n        while (current != null) {\\n            System.out.print(current.value + \" \");\\n            current = current.next;\\n        }\\n        System.out.println();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation:\\n\\n- **Element<E>**:\\n  - The `Element` class acts as a node in our linked list, holding a value of type `E` and a reference to the next node.\\n\\n- **LinkedListMySet**:\\n  - The `head` points to the first element in the linked list.\\n  - The `size` keeps track of the number of elements in the set.\\n\\n- **Method Details**:\\n  - `add(E element)`: Checks if an element is already in the set using `contains()` before adding it to the head of the list. Ensures uniqueness.\\n  - `contains(E element)`: Iterates over the list to determine if an element is present.\\n  - `remove(E element)`: Removes the specified element, handling cases where the element is the head or somewhere in the middle/end.\\n  - `size()`: Returns the current size of the set.\\n  - `isEmpty()`: Checks if there are any elements in the set.\\n\\nThis simple implementation provides a custom set using a linked list structure from scratch, achieving the desired functionality without relying on Java\\'s built-in collections.', 'Q: Implement a concrete class MapMySet that uses a HashMap (dictionary) as the internal data structure. You can use Map and HashMap from the Java class library to do this.\\nA: Implementing a `MapMySet` class that uses a `HashMap` as the internal data structure involves leveraging the map to simulate a set. In a set data structure, elements are stored uniquely without any duplication, which we can achieve with a `HashMap` by using the elements as keys and arbitrary constant predefined objects as values.\\n\\nHere\\'s a possible implementation of the `MapMySet` class:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.HashMap;\\nimport java.util.Iterator;\\nimport java.util.Map;\\n\\npublic class MapMySet<T> implements Iterable<T> {\\n    \\n    // The HashMap that will store our set elements\\n    private Map<T, Object> map;\\n\\n    // This is a placeholder value; it doesn\\'t matter what it is.\\n    private static final Object DUMMY_VALUE = new Object();\\n\\n    // Constructor\\n    public MapMySet() {\\n        map = new HashMap<>();\\n    }\\n\\n    // Add an element to the set\\n    public boolean add(T element) {\\n        // Put the element in the map. If the element was already present, it returns the DUMMY_VALUE,\\n        // so add should only return true if the element was not already present.\\n        return map.put(element, DUMMY_VALUE) == null;\\n    }\\n    \\n    // Remove an element from the set\\n    public boolean remove(T element) {\\n        // Remove the element from the map\\n        return map.remove(element) == DUMMY_VALUE;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Check if an element is in the set\\n    public boolean contains(T element) {\\n        // Simply check if the map contains the key\\n        return map.containsKey(element);\\n    }\\n\\n    // Return the size of the set\\n    public int size() {\\n        // The size of the set is the size of the key set of the map\\n        return map.size();\\n    }\\n\\n    // Clear all elements from the set\\n    public void clear() {\\n        map.clear();\\n    }\\n\\n    // Check if the set is empty\\n    public boolean isEmpty() {\\n        return map.isEmpty();\\n    }\\n\\n    // Allow iteration over the elements in the set\\n    @Override\\n    public Iterator<T> iterator() {\\n        return map.keySet().iterator();\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to return the elements as a string representation\\n    @Override\\n    public String toString() {\\n        return map.keySet().toString();\\n    }\\n    \\n    // Main method for testing purposes\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        MapMySet<String> mySet = new MapMySet<>();\\n        mySet.add(\"apple\");\\n        mySet.add(\"banana\");\\n        mySet.add(\"orange\");\\n\\n        System.out.println(\"Set contains apple: \" + mySet.contains(\"apple\"));\\n        System.out.println(\"Set size: \" + mySet.size());\\n        System.out.println(\"Removing apple\");\\n        mySet.remove(\"apple\");\\n        System.out.println(\"Set contains apple: \" + mySet.contains(\"apple\"));\\n        System.out.println(\"Set is empty: \" + mySet.isEmpty());\\n        System.out.println(\"Set elements: \" + mySet);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation:\\n- **Use of `HashMap`:** We use the keys of the `HashMap` to store the elements of the set. The value is a constant placeholder (e.g., `DUMMY_VALUE`) because we\\'re not utilizing it.\\n  \\n- **Operations:**\\n  - **Add:** The `add` method inserts the element as a key into the `HashMap`, returning `true` only if it wasn\\'t already present.\\n  - **Remove:** Removes the key from the map and returns `true` if the element was present.\\n  - **Contains:** Directly checks for the presence of the key.\\n  - **Size, Clear, and IsEmpty:** These operations directly correspond to the methods available in `HashMap`.\\n\\n- **Iterator:** Since sets are commonly iterated over, we implement `Iterable<T>`, allowing the use of enhanced for-loops.\\n\\nThis implementation should provide a reliable set-like behavior using a `HashMap` internally.', 'Q: (Harder) Add the ability to save the contents of a set to a file using a text representation, and to read the file and re-create the set object. Get this working for common types such as Integer, String, Double, etc. Getting file load/save working for any type you can put in a set is more complex - see if you can get something working. Challenge Questions\\nA: To enable saving and loading the contents of a `Set` in Java, you\\'ll need to perform both serialization (for saving) and deserialization (for loading). For common types like `Integer`, `String`, `Double`, etc., the task is straightforward. For more complex or custom types, you can use Java\\'s `Serializable` interface or consider more advanced serialization frameworks like Gson (if JSON serialization is preferred) or even custom serialization logic based on your use case.\\n\\nHere\\'s a basic implementation for saving and loading a `Set` of `Serializable` objects to and from a text file:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.io.*;\\nimport java.util.HashSet;\\nimport java.util.Set;\\n\\npublic class SetFileOperations {\\n\\n    /**\\n     * Saves a set to a file.\\n     *\\n     * @param set      the set to save\\n     * @param filename the name of the file to save the set to\\n     * @throws IOException if an I/O error occurs\\n     */\\n    public static void saveSetToFile(Set<?> set, String filename) throws IOException {\\n        try (ObjectOutputStream oos = new ObjectOutputStream(new FileOutputStream(filename))) {\\n            oos.writeObject(set);\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * Reads a set from a file.\\n     *\\n     * @param filename the name of the file to read the set from\\n     * @return the set read from the file\\n     * @throws IOException            if an I/O error occurs\\n     * @throws ClassNotFoundException if the class of a serialized object cannot be found\\n     */\\n    public static Set<?> loadSetFromFile(String filename) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException {\\n        try (ObjectInputStream ois = new ObjectInputStream(new FileInputStream(filename))) {\\n            Object object = ois.readObject();\\n            if (object instanceof Set<?>) {\\n                return (Set<?>) object;\\n            } else {\\n                throw new IOException(\"Data in file is not a valid set.\");\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        // Create a sample set\\n        Set<Object> sampleSet = new HashSet<>();\\n        sampleSet.add(\"Hello\");\\n        sampleSet.add(123);\\n        sampleSet.add(45.67);\\n\\n        String filename = \"set_data.txt\";\\n\\n        try {\\n            // Save the set to a file\\n            saveSetToFile(sampleSet, filename);\\n            System.out.println(\"Set saved successfully.\");\\n\\n            // Load the set from the file\\n            Set<?> loadedSet = loadSetFromFile(filename);\\n            System.out.println(\"Set loaded successfully: \" + loadedSet);\\n\\n        } catch (IOException | ClassNotFoundException e) {\\n            e.printStackTrace();\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation\\n\\n1. **Saving a Set**: We use an `ObjectOutputStream` wrapped around a `FileOutputStream` to write the `Set` object to a file. The `Set` can contain any objects that are `Serializable`.\\n\\n2. **Loading a Set**: An `ObjectInputStream` wrapped around a `FileInputStream` is used to read the `Set` object back. The deserialized object is checked to ensure it\\'s a `Set`.\\n\\n3. **Handling Common Types**: This approach works for any `Serializable` type, which includes many commonly-used Java objects. For custom objects, ensure they implement `Serializable`.\\n\\n4. **Error Handling**: We handle `IOException` (for I/O issues) and `ClassNotFoundException` (for class resolution issues).\\n\\n### Advanced Considerations\\n\\n- **Custom Serialization**: For more control over the serialization process, consider implementing `Externalizable` or custom implementations of `ObjectOutputStream` and `ObjectInputStream`.\\n\\n- **Non-Serializable Objects**: For objects that cannot be serialized, alternative approaches such as JSON libraries (like Gson or Jackson for JSON format) or XML libraries (like JAXB) may be required for serialization.\\n\\n- **Generic Handling**: If dealing with a wide variety of object types, ensure type safety with careful use of generics and Runtime Type Checking. Note that using `?` (wildcard) means any object type, which is convenient but not type-safe.\\n\\nThis basic implementation should be a good starting point; you can expand on this logic for more advanced serialization needs.', \"Q: The equals method in the MySet code is declared as: boolean equals(MySet<T> aSet); This doesn’t actually override the equals method inherited from class Object which has this signature: @Override boolean equals(Object obj); The parameter should be of type Object. If you are not sure why then go back and review the material on the equals method. Make all the modifications to replace equals with a version that correctly overrides the one inherited from Object. The hashCode method has not been implemented or overridden at all. Where required add hashCode so that it overrides the version inherited from class Object.\\nA: To properly override the `equals` method from the `Object` class in your `MySet` class, you need to ensure that the method signature exactly matches that of the `Object` class's `equals` method. The signature must take a parameter of type `Object`, not `MySet<T>`. Additionally, whenever you override `equals`, it's a good practice to also override `hashCode` to maintain consistency.\\n\\nHere's how you can modify your `MySet` class to correctly override both `equals` and `hashCode`:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.HashSet;\\nimport java.util.Set;\\nimport java.util.Objects;\\n\\npublic class MySet<T> {\\n    private Set<T> elements;\\n\\n    public MySet() {\\n        elements = new HashSet<>();\\n    }\\n\\n    // Adds an element to the set\\n    public boolean add(T element) {\\n        return elements.add(element);\\n    }\\n\\n    // Override equals method\\n    @Override\\n    public boolean equals(Object obj) {\\n        // Check if the object is the same reference\\n        if (this == obj) {\\n            return true;\\n        }\\n\\n        // Check if the object is an instance of MySet\\n        if (obj instanceof MySet) {\\n            MySet<?> otherSet = (MySet<?>) obj;\\n            // Compare the elements of both sets\\n            return elements.equals(otherSet.elements);\\n        }\\n\\n        // If obj is not a MySet\\n        return false;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Override hashCode method\\n    @Override\\n    public int hashCode() {\\n        // Use Objects.hash with the elements set to ensure consistency with equals\\n        return Objects.hash(elements);\\n    }\\n    \\n    // Additional methods you might have\\n    // ...\\n\\n    @Override\\n    public String toString() {\\n        return elements.toString();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Key Considerations:\\n\\n1. **equals Method:**\\n   - **Type Checking:** First check if `this` and `obj` are the same object using `==`. Then, ensure the `obj` is an instance of `MySet`. This guards against `ClassCastException`.\\n   - **Casting:** If `obj` is an instance of `MySet`, safely cast it and compare their `elements` sets.\\n   - **Equality Check:** Use the `equals` method on the `elements` set, which is typically a `HashSet`, and thus already implements value-based equality.\\n\\n2. **hashCode Method:**\\n   - **Consistency with equals:** The `hashCode` method must always return the same integer if `equals` considers two objects equal. This implementation uses `Objects.hash`, which combines the `hashCodes` of its contained elements.\\n\\nBy following these steps, you ensure that your implementation of `equals` and `hashCode` is correct and consistent with Java’s requirements for `Object` class contracts.\", 'Q: This question is more about understanding how generics with the wild card (‘?’) and super works. The generic type declaration for MySet uses <T extends Comparable<T>>, which doesn\\'t handle inheritance properly. For example, when you have a class hierarchy where a subclass doesn\\'t directly implement Comparable but its parent does. Make all the required modifications to your code to use <T extends Comparable<? super T>> instead to remove this restriction. Write some code using a set to demonstrate where this makes a difference. COMP0004 Exercises 5 5 of 5\\nA: To understand the nuances of generics using wildcards and the `super` keyword, it\\'s important to grasp how they relate to class hierarchies and interfaces like `Comparable`.\\n\\n### Problem Explanation\\n\\nSuppose you have a class hierarchy where a superclass implements `Comparable`, and a subclass doesn\\'t explicitly implement it. Using `<T extends Comparable<T>>` often restricts flexibility because it demands that the exact type T implements `Comparable<T>`. However, by using `<T extends Comparable<? super T>>`, you allow T to be comparable to its supertypes, which is often more appropriate for class hierarchies.\\n\\n**Example:**\\n\\n```java\\nclass Animal implements Comparable<Animal> {\\n    private String name;\\n    \\n    public Animal(String name) {\\n        this.name = name;\\n    }\\n    \\n    @Override\\n    public int compareTo(Animal other) {\\n        return this.name.compareTo(other.name);\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass Dog extends Animal {\\n    public Dog(String name) {\\n        super(name);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nIn this hierarchy, `Animal` implements `Comparable<Animal>`, but `Dog` does not directly implement `Comparable<Dog>`. Using `<T extends Comparable<T>>`, a `MySet<Dog>` wouldn\\'t work without additional implementation. The solution is `<T extends Comparable<? super T>>`, which allows `Dog` to be compared based on its superclass\\'s comparison method.\\n\\n### Solution Code\\n\\nLet\\'s implement a simple `MySet` class and demonstrate its usage with this hierarchy:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.TreeSet;\\n\\nclass MySet<T extends Comparable<? super T>> {\\n    private TreeSet<T> set = new TreeSet<>();\\n\\n    public void add(T element) {\\n        set.add(element);\\n    }\\n    \\n    public void displayElements() {\\n        for (T elem : set) {\\n            System.out.println(elem);\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        MySet<Animal> animalSet = new MySet<>();\\n        animalSet.add(new Animal(\"Lion\"));\\n        animalSet.add(new Animal(\"Tiger\"));\\n        \\n        MySet<Dog> dogSet = new MySet<>();\\n        dogSet.add(new Dog(\"Bulldog\"));\\n        dogSet.add(new Dog(\"Beagle\"));\\n        \\n        System.out.println(\"Animal Set:\");\\n        animalSet.displayElements();\\n        \\n        System.out.println(\"Dog Set:\");\\n        dogSet.displayElements();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Key Points\\n\\n1. **`<T extends Comparable<? super T>>`:** This generic declaration allows instances of T to be compared using any superclass\\'s Comparable implementation, thereby enabling more flexible comparisons along inheritance chains.\\n\\n2. **Usage of `MySet`:** The `MySet` class uses a `TreeSet` to manage elements that are naturally ordered. The `TreeSet` utilizes the `compareTo` method to keep its elements sorted, which is consistent with the `MySet` constraint.\\n\\n3. **Demonstration:** In the code, both `Animal` and `Dog` instances are added to separate `MySet` objects. This showcases how the change in the generic declaration allows the hierarchy to be maintained while still using `Comparable` functionality.\\n\\nThe use of `<T extends Comparable<? super T>>` thus abstracts the hierarchy interaction, allowing subclass objects to utilize their superclass\\'s comparison mechanics without directly implementing it themselves.', \"Q: Add a powerSet method to generate the Power Set (set of subsets) of a set. The use of generics makes this a bit tricky to solve. Hint, can you have a MySet of MySets, such as MySet<MySet<T extends Comparable<T>>> or will you have to be more creative to get this working? Don’t forget about searching online tutorials and resources for additional sources of information about generics.\\nA: To generate the power set of a set using generics in Java, you can implement this by leveraging recursion or an iterative approach with a bit manipulation technique. The power set of a set \\\\( S \\\\) is the set of all possible subsets of \\\\( S \\\\), including the empty set and \\\\( S \\\\) itself.\\n\\nBelow, I will provide a solution using a custom `MySet` class, demonstrating how we could use generics to create a power set method. This example uses a recursive approach.\\n\\nHere's a basic implementation:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\nimport java.util.HashSet;\\nimport java.util.List;\\nimport java.util.Set;\\n\\npublic class MySet<T extends Comparable<T>> {\\n    private Set<T> set;\\n\\n    public MySet() {\\n        this.set = new HashSet<>();\\n    }\\n\\n    public void add(T element) {\\n        set.add(element);\\n    }\\n\\n    public Set<T> getSet() {\\n        return set;\\n    }\\n\\n    public MySet<MySet<T>> powerSet() {\\n        MySet<MySet<T>> allSubsets = new MySet<>();\\n        List<T> list = new ArrayList<>(set);\\n        int n = list.size();\\n        \\n        // There are 2^n subsets\\n        int numberOfSubsets = 1 << n;\\n        \\n        // Loop through each possible subset\\n        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfSubsets; i++) {\\n            MySet<T> subset = new MySet<>();\\n            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {\\n                if ((i & (1 << j)) > 0) {\\n                    subset.add(list.get(j));\\n                }\\n            }\\n            allSubsets.add(subset);\\n        }\\n        \\n        return allSubsets;\\n    }\\n\\n    @Override\\n    public String toString() {\\n        return set.toString();\\n    }\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        MySet<Integer> mySet = new MySet<>();\\n        mySet.add(1);\\n        mySet.add(2);\\n        mySet.add(3);\\n\\n        MySet<MySet<Integer>> powerSet = mySet.powerSet();\\n        for (MySet<Integer> subset : powerSet.getSet()) {\\n            System.out.println(subset);\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation:\\n1. **MySet Class**: A generic `MySet` class is created where `T` is any type that extends `Comparable<T>`. This ensures that elements in the set can be compared if needed.\\n2. **add Method**: A simple method to add elements to the set.\\n3. **powerSet Method**: \\n   - It calculates the total number of subsets using bit manipulation (`1 << n`), which is equivalent to \\\\( 2^n \\\\) where \\\\( n \\\\) is the size of the set.\\n   - For each subset number (from 0 to \\\\(2^n - 1\\\\)), it uses bitwise operations to determine which elements are included in the current subset.\\n   - A new `MySet<T>` is created for each subset detected.\\n   - These subsets are stored in a `MySet<MySet<T>>`.\\n\\n4. **Main Method**: Demonstrates usage of the `MySet` class by creating a set, adding elements, and generating the power set.\\n\\nThis approach ensures that you handle generics appropriately and demonstrate how to manage sets of sets using Java's powerful generic and collection framework. This solution relies on bitmasking, which is efficient for this kind of combinatorial problem.\", 'Q: Modify your code to implement the Comparator interface for comparing values, rather than Comparable, allowing lambdas to be used to specify how comparison is done for the values you store in a set. Can you get this working for examples such as MySet<ArrayList<Integer>> or MySet<MySet<String>>? You will need to read up about the Comparator interface and why it is useful. The major advantage of Comparator is that you can compare values of any type and are no longer limited to subclasses of Comparable.\\nA: To implement a custom comparison strategy using the `Comparator` interface, we need to modify the code structure so that comparison logic can be specified at the time of use, rather than being embedded directly in the elements themselves, as is the case with `Comparable`.\\n\\nThe `Comparator` interface allows for flexible comparison logic that can be provided via lambda expressions or method references. This can be useful when working with nested generic types like `ArrayList<Integer>` or your custom `MySet<String>` class, as you can define how these complex types should be compared.\\n\\nBelow is a simple implementation of a custom set class, `MySet`, using the `Comparator` interface. This class uses a `TreeSet` internally to store the elements and relies on a `Comparator` to impose the order on its elements.\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.Comparator;\\nimport java.util.TreeSet;\\n\\npublic class MySet<T> {\\n    private TreeSet<T> set;\\n\\n    public MySet(Comparator<? super T> comparator) {\\n        this.set = new TreeSet<>(comparator);\\n    }\\n\\n    public boolean add(T element) {\\n        return set.add(element);\\n    }\\n\\n    public boolean contains(T element) {\\n        return set.contains(element);\\n    }\\n\\n    public boolean remove(T element) {\\n        return set.remove(element);\\n    }\\n\\n    @Override\\n    public String toString() {\\n        return set.toString();\\n    }\\n\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        // Using MySet with ArrayList<Integer>\\n        Comparator<ArrayList<Integer>> arrayListComparator = (list1, list2) -> {\\n            int sum1 = list1.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).sum();\\n            int sum2 = list2.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).sum();\\n            return Integer.compare(sum1, sum2);\\n        };\\n\\n        MySet<ArrayList<Integer>> mySet1 = new MySet<>(arrayListComparator);\\n        ArrayList<Integer> list1 = new ArrayList<>(List.of(1, 2, 3));\\n        ArrayList<Integer> list2 = new ArrayList<>(List.of(4, 5));\\n        mySet1.add(list1);\\n        mySet1.add(list2);\\n        System.out.println(\"MySet with ArrayList<Integer>:\" + mySet1);\\n\\n        // Using MySet with MySet<String>\\n        Comparator<MySet<String>> mySetComparator = (set1, set2) -> {\\n            int size1 = set1.set.size();\\n            int size2 = set2.set.size();\\n            return Integer.compare(size1, size2);\\n        };\\n\\n        MySet<MySet<String>> mySet2 = new MySet<>(mySetComparator);\\n        MySet<String> stringSet1 = new MySet<>(String::compareTo);\\n        stringSet1.add(\"apple\");\\n        stringSet1.add(\"banana\");\\n\\n        MySet<String> stringSet2 = new MySet<>(String::compareTo);\\n        stringSet2.add(\"cherry\");\\n\\n        mySet2.add(stringSet1);\\n        mySet2.add(stringSet2);\\n        System.out.println(\"MySet with MySet<String>:\" + mySet2);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation\\n\\n1. **Constructor with Comparator**: The `MySet` class is initialized with a `Comparator`. This allows you to define custom logic for comparing elements. The internal `TreeSet` uses this comparator.\\n\\n2. **Lambda Expressions for Comparators**:\\n   - For `ArrayList<Integer>`, the comparator sums the elements of each list and compares these sums. This allows lists to be sorted based on their total.\\n   - For `MySet<String>`, the comparator simply compares the sizes of the sets. This allows nested sets to be ordered by the number of elements they contain.\\n\\n3. **Usage Example**:\\n   - The `main` method demonstrates how to use `MySet` with a `Comparator`, sort `ArrayList<Integer>` by the sum of its elements, and `MySet<String>` by the number of elements in each set.\\n\\nThis flexible approach for defining comparison logic is powerful because it allows you to change how objects are compared without modifying the objects themselves or relying on them to implement `Comparable`.', \"Question 1\\n\\nQUESTION:\\n1.

Errors related to types might only appear at runtime. Example: JavaScript. - **Strong Typing:** Strongly typed languages enforce strict type rules, often requiring explicit conversions.\", 'Errors related to types might only appear at runtime. Example: JavaScript. - **Strong Typing:** Strongly typed languages enforce strict type rules, often requiring explicit conversions. Type errors are usually caught at compile time. Example: Java. - **Static Typing:** In statically typed languages, variable types are known at compile time. This can lead to early error detection and optimization. Example: Java. - **Dynamic Typing:** In dynamically typed languages, types are determined at runtime. This allows more flexibility but can lead to runtime errors. Example: Python. ### c) Consider this recursive method:\\n```java\\npublic static int f(int n)  \\n{ \\n  if (n < 1) { return 1; } \\n  else { return f(n-1) + f(n-1); } \\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### i) List the advantages and disadvantages of using recursion with an object-oriented language like Java. **Advantages:**\\n- **Simplicity:** Recursive solutions can be more intuitive and easier to write for problems that have a natural recursive structure (e.g., tree traversal). - **Readability:** Recursive code can be more readable and closer to the problem description. **Disadvantages:**\\n- **Performance:** Recursive calls can be less efficient due to overhead from multiple function calls and can lead to stack overflow errors for deep recursions. - **Memory Usage:** Each recursive call adds a new layer to the call stack, which can consume more memory. #### ii) Give the output of the following method calls: `f(0), f(1), f(2), f(3), f(4), f(5)`. - `f(0)`: 1\\n- `f(1)`: 2\\n- `f(2)`: 4\\n- `f(3)`: 8\\n- `f(4)`: 16\\n- `f(5)`: 32\\n\\n#### iii) State what algorithm the method implements.

[8 marks]\\nFotal30 Marksl\\n4\\ncoMPl008\\nContinued\\n\\nANSWER:\\nSure, let's go through each part of the question. ### 2. a) i) Define static, strong, weak, and dynamic typing. - **Static Typing**: The type of a variable is known at compile time. This means you must declare the type of a variable before using it. Errors related to types are caught early in the development process. Example: Java. - **Strong Typing**: The language enforces strict type rules, and implicit conversions between types are limited. This helps prevent errors but can require more explicit conversions. Example: Python. - **Weak Typing**: The language is more flexible with type conversions, allowing implicit conversions between different types. This can lead to unexpected behavior if not managed carefully. Example: JavaScript. - **Dynamic Typing**: The type of a variable is determined at runtime. This allows for more flexible and concise code but can lead to runtime errors if types are not managed properly. Example: Python. ### ii) State which typing categories the following languages belong to: Java, C++, Groovy, JavaScript, Ruby, and Prolog. - **Java**: Static, Strong\\n- **C++**: Static, Strong\\n- **Groovy**: Dynamic, Strong\\n- **JavaScript**: Dynamic, Weak\\n- **Ruby**: Dynamic, Strong\\n- **Prolog**: Dynamic, Strong\\n\\n### b) Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of pointers in C++ compared to references in Java. **Advantages of Pointers in C++:**\\n- **Direct Memory Access**: Pointers provide direct access to memory, allowing for efficient manipulation of data structures like arrays and linked lists.\", '**Advantages of Pointers in C++:**\\n- **Direct Memory Access**: Pointers provide direct access to memory, allowing for efficient manipulation of data structures like arrays and linked lists. - **Dynamic Memory Management**: Pointers are essential for dynamic memory allocation, enabling the creation of complex data structures like trees and graphs. **Disadvantages of Pointers in C++:**\\n- **Complexity and Errors**: Pointers can lead to complex code and are prone to errors such as null pointer dereferencing and memory leaks. - **Security Risks**: Improper use of pointers can lead to vulnerabilities like buffer overflows. **Advantages of References in Java:**\\n- **Simplicity and Safety**: Java references abstract away memory management, reducing the risk of errors and security issues. - **Automatic Garbage Collection**: Java handles memory management automatically, freeing developers from manual memory deallocation. **Disadvantages of References in Java:**\\n- **Less Control**: Java references provide less control over memory, which can be a limitation for performance-critical applications. - **No Pointer Arithmetic**: Java does not support pointer arithmetic, limiting certain low-level operations. ### c) Define a list element class and explain how it is used in the implementation of a linked list class. A list element class typically represents a node in a linked list. Here’s a basic example in Java:\\n\\n```java\\nclass ListNode {\\n    int data; // Data stored in the node\\n    ListNode next; // Reference to the next node\\n\\n    // Constructor\\n    public ListNode(int data) {\\n        this.data = data;\\n        this.next = null;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Usage in Linked List Implementation:**\\n- **Head Node**: The linked list maintains a reference to the first node (head). - **Traversal**: Nodes are linked via the `next` reference, allowing traversal from the head to the end. - **Insertion/Deletion**: Operations involve updating the `next` references to add or remove nodes. ### d) Explain the concept of an iterator and outline how in-order iteration is implemented for an ordered binary tree class. **Concept of an Iterator:**\\n- An iterator is an object that enables traversal of a container, like a list or a tree, without exposing its underlying structure. It provides methods to access elements sequentially.', '**Concept of an Iterator:**\\n- An iterator is an object that enables traversal of a container, like a list or a tree, without exposing its underlying structure. It provides methods to access elements sequentially. **In-Order Iteration for an Ordered Binary Tree:**\\n- **In-Order Traversal**: Visit the left subtree, the root node, and then the right subtree. - **Implementation Steps**:\\n  1. Start at the root node. 2. Recursively traverse the left subtree. 3. Visit the root node (process the data). 4. Recursively traverse the right subtree. Here\\'s a basic outline in Java:\\n\\n```java\\nclass TreeNode {\\n    int data;\\n    TreeNode left, right;\\n\\n    public TreeNode(int data) {\\n        this.data = data;\\n        left = right = null;\\n    }\\n}\\n\\nclass BinaryTree {\\n    TreeNode root;\\n\\n    // In-order traversal method\\n    void inOrderTraversal(TreeNode node) {\\n        if (node != null) {\\n            inOrderTraversal(node.left); // Visit left subtree\\n            System.out.print(node.data + \" \"); // Visit root\\n            inOrderTraversal(node.right); // Visit right subtree\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis traversal ensures that nodes are processed in ascending order for a binary search tree.', 'Question 3\\n\\nQUESTION:\\n3.\\na) Concisely explain each of the following:\\nencapsulation, dynamic binding, generics, final, static variable, null\\n[2 marks each, total of 12]\\nb) A Stack is a last-in first-out (LIFO) data structure.

[10 marks]\\nFotal 30 Marksl\\nEnd of Section B\\n\\nANSWER:\\n### 3. a) Concisely Explain Each of the Following:\\n\\n1. **Encapsulation**:\\n   - Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit.', '**Encapsulation**:\\n   - Encapsulation is the concept of wrapping data (variables) and code (methods) together as a single unit. In Java, this is achieved using classes. It restricts direct access to some components, which can prevent accidental interference and misuse of the methods and data. Access is controlled using access modifiers like `private`, `protected`, and `public`. 2. **Dynamic Binding**:\\n   - Dynamic binding, also known as late binding, occurs when the method to be called is determined at runtime. This is typically used in the context of polymorphism, where a superclass reference is used to call methods on subclass objects. 3. **Generics**:\\n   - Generics enable types (classes and interfaces) to be parameters when defining classes, interfaces, and methods. The main advantage is type safety, as it allows for compile-time type checking and eliminates the need for type casting. 4. **Final**:\\n   - The `final` keyword in Java is used to declare constants, prevent method overriding, and inheritance. A `final` variable\\'s value cannot be changed once initialized, a `final` method cannot be overridden, and a `final` class cannot be subclassed. 5. **Static Variable**:\\n   - A static variable is shared among all instances of a class. It is associated with the class itself rather than any object instance. Static variables are used for defining common properties of all objects. 6. **Null**:\\n   - `null` is a special literal in Java that represents a null reference, meaning it points to no object. It is the default value of any reference variable that is not initialized. ### 3. b) Java Class `StackInt`\\n\\n```java\\npublic class StackInt {\\n    private int[] stackArray;\\n    private int top;\\n    private int maxSize;\\n\\n    // Constructor\\n    public StackInt(int size) {\\n        if (size < 10 || size > 1000) {\\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Size must be between 10 and 1000. \");\\n        }\\n        this.maxSize = size;\\n        this.stackArray = new int[maxSize];\\n        this.top = -1; // Indicates an empty stack\\n    }\\n\\n    // Push method to add an element to the stack\\n    public void push(int value) {\\n        if (top == maxSize - 1) {\\n            throw new StackOverflowError(\"Stack is full.', '\");\\n        }\\n        stackArray[++top] = value;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Pop method to remove and return the top element of the stack\\n    public int pop() {\\n        if (top == -1) {\\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Stack is empty. \");\\n        }\\n        return stackArray[top--];\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 3. c) Example Code for `StackInt`\\n\\n```java\\npublic class StackIntExample {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        try {\\n            StackInt stack = new StackInt(15); // Normal usage\\n\\n            // Pushing elements onto the stack\\n            stack.push(10);\\n            stack.push(20);\\n            stack.push(30);\\n\\n            // Popping elements from the stack\\n            System.out.println(stack.pop()); // Outputs 30\\n            System.out.println(stack.pop()); // Outputs 20\\n\\n            // Exception cases\\n            StackInt smallStack = new StackInt(5);\\n            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {\\n                smallStack.push(i);\\n            }\\n            // This will throw StackOverflowError\\n            // smallStack.push(6);\\n\\n            // Empty stack pop\\n            StackInt emptyStack = new StackInt(10);\\n            // This will throw IllegalStateException\\n            // emptyStack.pop();\\n\\n        } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {\\n            System.out.println(\"Caught exception: \" + e.getMessage());\\n        } catch (StackOverflowError e) {\\n            System.out.println(\"Caught exception: \" + e.getMessage());\\n        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {\\n            System.out.println(\"Caught exception: \" + e.getMessage());\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis code demonstrates normal usage of the `StackInt` class, as well as handling exceptions when the stack is full or empty.', 'Question 1\\n\\nQUESTION:\\nCOMP1008 \\n1 \\nTurn Over \\nCOMP1008 Object-Oriented Programming (2009) \\n \\nAnswer Question 1 in SECTION A and TWO questions from SECTION B \\n(THREE questions in total) \\n \\nMarks for each part of each question are indicated in square brackets.

An abstract class in Java serves as a blueprint for other classes. It cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed.

Here's a brief outline of how it can be implemented in Java:\\n\\n1. **Array of Buckets**: Create an array where each element is a linked list (or any list structure). Each index in the array represents a bucket. 2. **Hash Function**: Implement a hash function to determine the index for storing key-value pairs. A simple hash function could be `key.hashCode() % array.length`. 3. **Insertion**: To insert a key-value pair, compute the hash to find the appropriate bucket. Add the pair to the list at that index. If the key already exists, update the value. 4. **Searching**: To find a value by key, compute the hash to locate the bucket, then iterate through the list to find the key. 5.\", 'If the key already exists, update the value. 4. **Searching**: To find a value by key, compute the hash to locate the bucket, then iterate through the list to find the key. 5. **Deletion**: To delete a key-value pair, compute the hash to locate the bucket, then remove the key from the list. 6. **Handling Collisions**: Collisions are handled by adding multiple entries to the same bucket (linked list). ### b) Range Class in Java\\n\\nHere\\'s how the `Range` class can be implemented:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\n\\npublic class Range {\\n    private int lower;\\n    private int upper;\\n\\n    // Constructor\\n    public Range(int lower, int upper) {\\n        if (lower >= upper) {\\n            throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Lower limit must be less than upper limit. \");\\n        }\\n        this.lower = lower;\\n        this.upper = upper;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to get the lower limit\\n    public int getLower() {\\n        return lower;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to get the upper limit\\n    public int getUpper() {\\n        return upper;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to check if a number is in the range\\n    public boolean contains(int n) {\\n        return n >= lower && n <= upper;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to get all values in the range\\n    public ArrayList<Integer> getValues() {\\n        ArrayList<Integer> values = new ArrayList<>();\\n        for (int i = lower; i <= upper; i++) {\\n            values.add(i);\\n        }\\n        return values;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### c) Unit Testing\\n\\n#### i) Explain the Idea of Unit Testing\\n\\nUnit testing involves testing individual components or functions of a program to ensure they work as intended. It is typically automated and focuses on a small part of the application, such as a single method or class. The goal is to validate that each unit of the software performs as expected, which helps in identifying bugs early in the development process. #### ii) Unit Testing the Range Class\\n\\nTo unit test the `Range` class, we should consider the following tests:\\n\\n1. **Constructor Tests**:\\n   - Test with valid lower and upper limits. - Test with lower limit equal to upper limit (should throw exception). - Test with lower limit greater than upper limit (should throw exception). 2. **Method Tests**:\\n   - `getLower()`: Verify it returns the correct lower limit.', '- Test with lower limit equal to upper limit (should throw exception). - Test with lower limit greater than upper limit (should throw exception). 2. **Method Tests**:\\n   - `getLower()`: Verify it returns the correct lower limit. - `getUpper()`: Verify it returns the correct upper limit. - `contains(int n)`: \\n     - Test with a number within the range (should return true). - Test with a number below the range (should return false). - Test with a number above the range (should return false). - `getValues()`: \\n     - Verify it returns an `ArrayList` containing all integers from lower to upper limit. These tests ensure that the `Range` class behaves correctly under various conditions.', \"Question 4\\n\\nQUESTION:\\n3. \\n \\na) Concisely explain each of the following: \\nstatic method, generic class, protected, final, overloading, call-by-value \\n[2 marks each, total of 12] \\n \\n \\n \\nb)  \\n \\ni) Write method that takes a parameter of type int, with a value greater than \\nzero, and returns an int[] containing the digits that make up the parameter \\nvalue.

[9 marks] \\n[Total 30 Marks]\\nCOMP1008 \\n6 \\nContinued\\n\\nANSWER:\\n### a) Concisely explain each of the following:\\n\\n1. **Static Method**:\\n   - A static method belongs to the class rather than any instance of the class. It can be called without creating an object of the class. Static methods can access static variables and other static methods directly. 2. **Generic Class**:\\n   - A generic class allows the creation of classes with a placeholder for the data type. This enables the class to be used with different data types while maintaining type safety. For example, `class Box<T>` can hold any type `T`. 3. **Protected**:\\n   - The `protected` access modifier allows access to the member variables and methods of a class within its own package and by subclasses. It provides more accessibility than `private` but is more restrictive than `public`. 4. **Final**:\\n   - The `final` keyword can be used with variables, methods, and classes. A final variable cannot be reassigned, a final method cannot be overridden, and a final class cannot be subclassed. 5. **Overloading**:\\n   - Method overloading allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, as long as their parameter lists are different. It provides flexibility in method usage. 6. **Call-by-Value**:\\n   - In call-by-value, a copy of the actual parameter's value is passed to the method.\", \"It provides flexibility in method usage. 6. **Call-by-Value**:\\n   - In call-by-value, a copy of the actual parameter's value is passed to the method. Changes made to the parameter inside the method do not affect the original value outside the method. Java uses call-by-value for all parameter passing. ### b) \\n\\n#### i) Method to return an array of digits from an integer:\\n\\n```java\\npublic int[] getDigits(int number) {\\n    // Convert the number to a string to easily access each digit\\n    String numberStr = Integer.toString(number);\\n    \\n    // Create an array of the same length as the number of digits\\n    int[] digits = new int[numberStr.length()];\\n    \\n    // Fill the array with the digits of the number\\n    for (int i = 0; i < numberStr.length(); i++) {\\n        // Convert each character back to an integer\\n        digits[i] = numberStr.charAt(i) - '0';\\n    }\\n    \\n    return digits;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### ii) Method to check if two integers contain the same digits:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.Arrays;\\n\\npublic boolean haveSameDigits(int num1, int num2) {\\n    // Convert both numbers to strings\\n    String str1 = Integer.toString(num1);\\n    String str2 = Integer.toString(num2);\\n    \\n    // If lengths are different, they can't have the same digits\\n    if (str1.length() != str2.length()) {\\n        return false;\\n    }\\n    \\n    // Convert strings to character arrays\\n    char[] arr1 = str1.toCharArray();\\n    char[] arr2 = str2.toCharArray();\\n    \\n    // Sort the character arrays\\n    Arrays.sort(arr1);\\n    Arrays.sort(arr2);\\n    \\n    // Compare sorted arrays\\n    return Arrays.equals(arr1, arr2);\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThese methods ensure that the input numbers are processed correctly to meet the requirements of the problem.\", 'Question 5\\n\\nQUESTION:\\n4. \\n \\n \\na) List the properties of C++ pointers and Java references, and explain why the \\nJava language designers chose references instead of pointers.

By eliminating pointer arithmetic and direct memory access, Java reduces the risk of memory corruption and makes the language safer and easier to use. ### b) Immutable Objects\\n\\n**Definition:**\\nAn immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. Examples include instances of the `String` class in Java. **Benefits:**\\n- **Thread Safety:** Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe since their state cannot change. - **Simplicity:** They simplify reasoning about code because their state is predictable. - **Caching:** They can be cached and reused without concern for changes, improving performance. - **No Side Effects:** They prevent unintended side effects, making code more reliable. ### c) Shallow vs. Deep Copy\\n\\n**Shallow Copy:**\\n- Copies the object\\'s top-level structure, not the nested objects. - Changes to nested objects affect both the original and the copy. **Deep Copy:**\\n- Copies the object and all objects it references, recursively. - Changes to nested objects do not affect the original. **Example:**\\nConsider a class `Person` with a field `Address`. A shallow copy of `Person` would copy the `Address` reference, while a deep copy would create a new `Address` object. The difference matters when you need independent copies of complex objects. ### d) Evaluation of `M m = new M(\"hello\",2);`\\n\\n1. **Memory Allocation:** Memory is allocated for a new `M` object. 2. **Constructor Call:** The constructor `M(String, int)` is called with arguments `\"hello\"` and `2`. 3. **Superclass Constructor:** The constructor of the superclass `N` is called, which in turn calls the constructor of `Object`. 4. **Initialization:** Fields in `M` are initialized, followed by fields in `N`. 5. **Reference Assignment:** The reference `m` is assigned to the newly created `M` object.', '4. **Initialization:** Fields in `M` are initialized, followed by fields in `N`. 5. **Reference Assignment:** The reference `m` is assigned to the newly created `M` object. ### e) Method Implementation\\n\\n```java\\npublic boolean isValid(String s) {\\n    // Split the string by comma\\n    String[] parts = s.split(\",\");\\n    \\n    // Check if there are exactly two parts\\n    if (parts.length == 2) {\\n        // Ensure both parts are non-empty words\\n        return !parts[0].isEmpty() && !parts[1].isEmpty();\\n    }\\n    \\n    // Return false if the conditions are not met\\n    return false;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**Explanation:**\\n- The method splits the string `s` by a comma. - It checks if there are exactly two parts. - It ensures both parts are non-empty. - Returns `true` if both conditions are satisfied, otherwise `false`.

[2 marks]\\n\\nAn abstract class in Java serves as a blueprint for other classes. It cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed. The primary role of an abstract class is to provide a common interface and share code among related classes. It can contain abstract methods (methods without a body) that must be implemented by subclasses, as well as concrete methods (methods with a body) that can be shared among subclasses.

The goal is to validate that each unit of the software performs as expected. Unit tests are typically automated and written by developers to ensure that a particular function or class behaves correctly. This approach helps in identifying bugs early in the development cycle, facilitates code refactoring, and ensures that new changes do not break existing functionality. #### ii) Outline how the Sequence class should be Unit tested\\n\\nTo unit test the `Sequence` class, you can use a testing framework like JUnit. Here are the tests that should be carried out:\\n\\n1. **Constructor Tests:**\\n   - Test with valid parameters to ensure the object is created successfully. - Test with invalid parameters (e.g., negative or zero values) to ensure exceptions are thrown. 2. **getStart() Method Test:**\\n   - Verify that the method returns the correct start value. 3. **getCount() Method Test:**\\n   - Verify that the method returns the correct count value. 4. **contains() Method Tests:**\\n   - Test with a number that is in the sequence to ensure it returns `true`. - Test with a number that is not in the sequence to ensure it returns `false`. 5. **getValues() Method Test:**\\n   - Verify that the method returns an `ArrayList` containing the correct sequence of numbers.', '- Test with a number that is not in the sequence to ensure it returns `false`. 5. **getValues() Method Test:**\\n   - Verify that the method returns an `ArrayList` containing the correct sequence of numbers.

Let's break down each part of the question. ### a) Chained Hash Table (Map) in Java\\n\\nA chained hash table is a data structure that uses an array of lists to handle collisions. Here's an outline of how you might implement a chained hash table in Java:\\n\\n1. **Class Structure**:\\n   - Create a class `ChainedHashTable`. - Define an array of `LinkedList<Entry>` to store the entries. 2. **Entry Class**:\\n   - Create a nested class `Entry` to store key-value pairs. - This class should have fields for the key and value, and appropriate constructors and getters. 3. **Hash Function**:\\n   - Implement a hash function to determine the index for each key. This is often done using `key.hashCode() % table.length`. 4. **Insert Method**:\\n   - Calculate the index using the hash function. - Add the entry to the linked list at that index. 5. **Search Method**:\\n   - Use the hash function to find the index. - Traverse the linked list at that index to find the key. 6. **Remove Method**:\\n   - Use the hash function to find the index. - Traverse the linked list to find and remove the entry with the matching key.\", \"- Traverse the linked list at that index to find the key. 6. **Remove Method**:\\n   - Use the hash function to find the index. - Traverse the linked list to find and remove the entry with the matching key. ### b) Methods for Digit Manipulation\\n\\n#### i) Method to Return Digits of an Integer\\n\\nHere's a method to return an array of digits from an integer:\\n\\n```java\\npublic int[] getDigits(int number) {\\n    // Convert the number to a string to easily access each digit\\n    String numberStr = Integer.toString(number);\\n    \\n    // Create an array of the same length as the number of digits\\n    int[] digits = new int[numberStr.length()];\\n    \\n    // Fill the array with the digits\\n    for (int i = 0; i < numberStr.length(); i++) {\\n        // Convert each character back to an integer\\n        digits[i] = Character.getNumericValue(numberStr.charAt(i));\\n    }\\n    \\n    return digits;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### ii) Method to Check if Two Integers Have the Same Digits\\n\\nHere's a method to check if two integers have the same digits:\\n\\n```java\\npublic boolean haveSameDigits(int num1, int num2) {\\n    // Convert both numbers to strings\\n    String str1 = Integer.toString(num1);\\n    String str2 = Integer.toString(num2);\\n    \\n    // If the lengths are different, they can't have the same digits\\n    if (str1.length() != str2.length()) {\\n        return false;\\n    }\\n    \\n    // Convert strings to character arrays\\n    char[] arr1 = str1.toCharArray();\\n    char[] arr2 = str2.toCharArray();\\n    \\n    // Sort both arrays\\n    java.util.Arrays.sort(arr1);\\n    java.util.Arrays.sort(arr2);\\n    \\n    // Compare sorted arrays\\n    return java.util.Arrays.equals(arr1, arr2);\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation\\n\\n- **Chained Hash Table**: Uses an array of linked lists to handle collisions by storing multiple entries at each index. - **Digit Extraction**: Converts the integer to a string to easily iterate through each digit and store them in an array. - **Digit Comparison**: Sorts the digits of both numbers and compares them to determine if they contain the same digits.

[4 marks]\\n\\nAn **immutable object** is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. In Java, examples include instances of the `String` class and wrapper classes like `Integer`, `Double`, etc. **Why immutable objects are useful:**\\n\\n1. **Thread Safety:** Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe because their state cannot change, eliminating synchronization issues in concurrent environments. 2. **Simplicity:** They are easier to understand and use since their state is predictable and cannot change unexpectedly. 3. **Caching and Optimization:** Immutable objects can be cached and reused without concern for their state being altered, which can improve performance. 4. **Security:** They provide a secure way to share data without the risk of it being modified by other code. ### b) Given the statement:  \\nM m = new M(\"hello\",2);  \\nand knowing that class M is a subclass of class N, which in turn is a subclass of class Object, explain in detail what happens when the statement is evaluated. [8 marks]\\n\\n1. **Memory Allocation:** The `new` keyword is used to allocate memory for a new object of class `M`. 2. **Constructor Call:** The constructor `M(String, int)` is called with the arguments `\"hello\"` and `2`. This initializes the object.', '2. **Constructor Call:** The constructor `M(String, int)` is called with the arguments `\"hello\"` and `2`. This initializes the object. If `M` does not have a constructor that takes these parameters, a compilation error occurs. 3. **Superclass Constructor:** Before executing the body of `M`\\'s constructor, the constructor of its superclass `N` is called. This is done implicitly if not explicitly specified using `super()`. 4. **Object Initialization:** The fields of `M` are initialized, and any initialization code in the constructor is executed. 5. **Reference Assignment:** The reference variable `m` is assigned to the newly created object of type `M`. 6. **Type Hierarchy:** `m` is of type `M`, but it can also be treated as type `N` or `Object` due to inheritance. ### c) Write a method with this signature: \\n```java\\npublic boolean isValid(String s)\\n```\\nthat returns true if the String parameter contains two words separated by a single comma. For example, given the String “the, and” the method would return true. For the method to return true, the parameter must consist of words in lower case characters only, with no spaces or other characters except for the comma. Otherwise, the method returns false.

If not, return `false`. - **Validating Each Part:** We use a regular expression `[a-z]+` to ensure each part is a lowercase word with no spaces or other characters. - **Return Result:** If all checks pass, the method returns `true`; otherwise, it returns `false`.', \"Question 1\\n\\nQUESTION:\\n1 \\nCOMPlO08 Object-Oriented Programming (2010) \\nAnswer ALL of SECTION A and TWO questions from SECTION B \\n(THREE questions in total) \\nMarks for each part of each question are indicated in square brackets.

It also has a constructor that initializes these attributes and getter methods for each attribute.\", '### a) i) Java version of the `Information` class\\n\\nThe `Information` class has three private attributes: `address`, `phone`, and `email`. It also has a constructor that initializes these attributes and getter methods for each attribute. ```java\\npublic class Information {\\n    private String address;\\n    private String phone;\\n    private String email;\\n\\n    // Constructor\\n    public Information(String address, String phone, String email) {\\n        this.address = address;\\n        this.phone = phone;\\n        this.email = email;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Getter for address\\n    public String getAddress() {\\n        return address;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Getter for phone\\n    public String getPhone() {\\n        return phone;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Getter for email\\n    public String getEmail() {\\n        return email;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### a) ii) Explanation of Immutable Objects\\n\\nAn immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created. In the context of the `Information` class, it means that once an `Information` object is instantiated with specific `address`, `phone`, and `email` values, these values cannot be changed. **Benefits of Immutable Objects:**\\n1. **Thread Safety:** Immutable objects are inherently thread-safe since their state cannot change, making them useful in concurrent applications. 2. **Ease of Use:** They can be freely shared and passed around without worrying about unexpected changes. 3. **Simplicity:** They simplify reasoning about code since the state of the object remains consistent throughout its lifecycle. ### b) i) Java version of the `Contact` class\\n\\nThe `Contact` class is abstract, meaning it cannot be instantiated directly and is intended to be subclassed. It has a constructor and two methods. ```java\\npublic abstract class Contact {\\n    private String name;\\n    private Information info;\\n\\n    // Constructor\\n    public Contact(String name, Information info) {\\n        this.name = name;\\n        this.info = info;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Getter for name\\n    public String getName() {\\n        return name;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Getter for information\\n    public Information getInformation() {\\n        return info;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### b) ii) Explanation of Abstract Class\\n\\nAn abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed. It can contain abstract methods (without implementation) that must be implemented by subclasses, as well as concrete methods (with implementation).', 'It can contain abstract methods (without implementation) that must be implemented by subclasses, as well as concrete methods (with implementation). **Role of Abstract Classes:**\\n1. **Code Reuse:** They allow sharing of common code among related classes. 2. **Polymorphism:** They enable polymorphic behavior by defining a common interface for subclasses. 3. **Design Flexibility:** They provide a flexible design framework that can be extended by subclasses. ### c) Java version of the `BusinessContact` class\\n\\nThe `BusinessContact` class extends `Contact` and adds an `accountNo` attribute. ```java\\npublic class BusinessContact extends Contact {\\n    private int accountNo;\\n\\n    // Constructor\\n    public BusinessContact(String name, Information info, int accountNo) {\\n        super(name, info);\\n        this.accountNo = accountNo;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Getter for account number\\n    public int getAccountNo() {\\n        return accountNo;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### d) Java version of the `ContactManager` class\\n\\nThe `ContactManager` class manages a list of contacts and provides methods to add personal and business contacts and find contacts by name. ```java\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\n\\npublic class ContactManager {\\n    private ArrayList<Contact> contacts;\\n\\n    // Constructor\\n    public ContactManager() {\\n        contacts = new ArrayList<>();\\n    }\\n\\n    // Add a personal contact\\n    public void addPersonalContact(String name, Information info, String birthday) {\\n        contacts.add(new PersonalContact(name, info, birthday));\\n    }\\n\\n    // Add a business contact\\n    public void addBusinessContact(String name, Information info, int accountNo) {\\n        contacts.add(new BusinessContact(name, info, accountNo));\\n    }\\n\\n    // Find all contacts by name\\n    public ArrayList<Contact> findAll(String name) {\\n        ArrayList<Contact> matchingContacts = new ArrayList<>();\\n        for (Contact contact : contacts) {\\n            if (contact.getName().equalsIgnoreCase(name)) {\\n                matchingContacts.add(contact);\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return matchingContacts;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### e) Unit Testing `PersonalContact`\\n\\nTo unit test an instance of `PersonalContact`, you should:\\n\\n1. **Test Constructor:** Ensure that the constructor initializes all fields correctly. 2. **Test Getters:** Verify that each getter method returns the expected value. 3. **Test Inheritance:** Check that `PersonalContact` correctly inherits from `Contact`. 4.', '2. **Test Getters:** Verify that each getter method returns the expected value. 3. **Test Inheritance:** Check that `PersonalContact` correctly inherits from `Contact`. 4. **Test Immutability:** Ensure that the `Information` object within `PersonalContact` remains unchanged after creation.

It allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. 2. **Protected**: \\n   - The `protected` keyword in Java is an access modifier. It allows a member to be accessible within its own package and by subclasses, even if they are in different packages. 3. **Static Final Variable**: \\n   - A `static final` variable in Java is a constant.\", 'It allows a member to be accessible within its own package and by subclasses, even if they are in different packages. 3. **Static Final Variable**: \\n   - A `static final` variable in Java is a constant. `static` means it belongs to the class, not instances of the class, and `final` means its value cannot be changed once initialized. 4. **Dynamic Binding**: \\n   - Dynamic binding is the process of resolving method calls at runtime rather than compile time. It allows Java to support method overriding and polymorphism. 5. **Encapsulation**: \\n   - Encapsulation is an object-oriented programming principle that restricts access to certain components of an object and can only be accessed through public methods. It helps in hiding the internal state of the object from the outside world. 6. **This**: \\n   - `this` is a reference variable in Java that refers to the current object. It is used to differentiate between instance variables and parameters with the same name, and to call other constructors in the same class. ### b) \\n\\n#### i) Write a class `IntPair` in Java:\\n\\n```java\\npublic class IntPair {\\n    private int first;\\n    private int second;\\n\\n    // Constructor to initialize the pair\\n    public IntPair(int first, int second) {\\n        this.first = first;\\n        this.second = second;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to return the first value\\n    public int getFirst() {\\n        return first;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to return the second value\\n    public int getSecond() {\\n        return second;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### ii) Explain and write a generic class `Pair`:\\n\\n- **Generic Class**: A generic class in Java allows you to define a class with a placeholder for a type, which can be specified when an instance of the class is created.

This eliminates the need for synchronization when accessing them across multiple threads. 2. **Simplicity**: Since the state of an immutable object cannot change, they are simpler to understand and use. There are no side effects from changing state, making the code easier to reason about. 3. **Caching and Optimization**: Immutable objects can be cached and reused without concern for their state being altered. This can lead to performance optimizations, such as using the same object instance in multiple places. 4. **Reliability**: Immutability helps avoid bugs related to unintended changes to an object's state, leading to more reliable and predictable code.\", 'Question 2\\n\\nQUESTION:\\n1.

To create an `Employee` class based on the UML diagram, we need to define the class with private fields for `name` and `address`, and provide a constructor along with getter methods. ```java\\npublic class Employee {\\n    private final String name;\\n    private final String address;\\n\\n    // Constructor\\n    public Employee(String name, String address) {\\n        this.name = name;\\n        this.address = address;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Getter for name\\n    public String getName() {\\n        return name;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Getter for address\\n    public String getAddress() {\\n        return address;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### a) ii) Explain what it means for an `Employee` object to be immutable and why immutable objects are useful. An immutable object is an object whose state cannot be modified after it is created.

[4 marks]\\n[Total 30 Marks]\\nCOMP1008\\n3\\nTurn Over\\n\\nANSWER:\\nSure, let's go through each part of the question. ### a) Explain each of the following:\\n\\n1. **Overloading**:\\n   - Overloading occurs when two or more methods in the same class have the same name but different parameters (different type, number, or both). It allows methods to perform similar functions with different inputs. - Example: \\n     ```java\\n     void print(int a) { }\\n     void print(String b) { }\\n     ```\\n\\n2. **Overriding**:\\n   - Overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass should have the same name, return type, and parameters. - Example:\\n     ```java\\n     class Parent {\\n         void show() { }\\n     }\\n     class Child extends Parent {\\n         @Override\\n         void show() { }\\n     }\\n     ```\\n\\n3. **Binding**:\\n   - Binding refers to the linking of a method call to the method body. There are two types:\\n     - **Static Binding**: Occurs at compile-time. Used for overloaded methods. - **Dynamic Binding**: Occurs at runtime. Used for overridden methods. 4. **Final Method**:\\n   - A final method cannot be overridden by subclasses.\", 'Used for overloaded methods. - **Dynamic Binding**: Occurs at runtime. Used for overridden methods. 4. **Final Method**:\\n   - A final method cannot be overridden by subclasses. This is used to prevent modification of the method\\'s behavior in subclasses. - Example:\\n     ```java\\n     class Example {\\n         final void display() { }\\n     }\\n     ```\\n\\n### b) SortedStringQueue Class\\n\\n#### i) Write a Java version of the class. ```java\\nimport java.util.LinkedList;\\n\\npublic class SortedStringQueue {\\n    private LinkedList<String> queue;\\n\\n    // Constructor to create an empty queue\\n    public SortedStringQueue() {\\n        queue = new LinkedList<>();\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to remove and return the string at the front of the queue\\n    public String get() throws SortedStringQueueException {\\n        if (queue.isEmpty()) {\\n            throw new SortedStringQueueException(\"Queue is empty\");\\n        }\\n        return queue.removeFirst();\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to add a string to the queue, keeping it sorted\\n    public void add(String str) {\\n        int index = 0;\\n        for (String s : queue) {\\n            if (s.compareTo(str) > 0) {\\n                break;\\n            }\\n            index++;\\n        }\\n        queue.add(index, str);\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to return the current length of the queue\\n    public int size() {\\n        return queue.size();\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to check if the queue is empty\\n    public boolean isEmpty() {\\n        return queue.isEmpty();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### ii) Write a class SortedStringQueueException. ```java\\npublic class SortedStringQueueException extends Exception {\\n    public SortedStringQueueException(String message) {\\n        super(message);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### iii) Show how a queue object is created and used. ```java\\npublic class Main {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        SortedStringQueue queue = new SortedStringQueue();\\n\\n        // Add elements to the queue\\n        queue.add(\"banana\");\\n        queue.add(\"apple\");\\n        queue.add(\"cherry\");\\n\\n        // Get the size of the queue\\n        System.out.println(\"Queue size: \" + queue.size());\\n\\n        // Check if the queue is empty\\n        System.out.println(\"Is queue empty? \"', '+ queue.isEmpty());\\n\\n        // Retrieve and remove elements from the queue\\n        try {\\n            System.out.println(\"Get from queue: \" + queue.get());\\n            System.out.println(\"Get from queue: \" + queue.get());\\n        } catch (SortedStringQueueException e) {\\n            System.out.println(e.getMessage());\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis example demonstrates creating a `SortedStringQueue` object, adding strings to it, checking its size, and retrieving elements while handling exceptions.', \"Question 4\\n\\nQUESTION:\\n3.\\na) Explain what an object reference is.

The array returned should not have any unused elements. [10 marks]\\n[Total 30 marks]\\nCOMP1008\\n4\\nContinued\\n\\nANSWER:\\nSure, let's go through each part of the question:\\n\\n### a) Explain what an object reference is. [3 marks]\\n\\nAn object reference is a variable that holds the memory address of an object, rather than the object itself. In programming languages like Java, when you create an object, you are actually creating a reference to that object. This allows you to manipulate the object through its reference without needing to know its physical memory location. Object references are essential for managing objects in memory efficiently, enabling operations like passing objects to methods or storing them in data structures. ### b) Describe how object references allow list-based data structures to be implemented, and how values are added and removed from a list. [7 marks]\\n\\nObject references are crucial for implementing list-based data structures such as linked lists, array lists, and more. Here's how they work:\\n\\n- **Implementation**: In a list-based structure, each element is an object reference pointing to the actual data object. For example, in a linked list, each node contains a reference to the next node, allowing traversal through the list. - **Adding Values**: To add a value, you create a new object and update the references. In a linked list, this involves setting the reference of the new node to point to the next node and updating the previous node's reference to point to the new node.\", \"In a linked list, this involves setting the reference of the new node to point to the next node and updating the previous node's reference to point to the new node. - **Removing Values**: To remove a value, you adjust the references to bypass the node to be removed. In a linked list, you update the reference of the preceding node to point to the node following the one being removed. Object references enable dynamic memory allocation and efficient manipulation of data structures without needing to copy entire objects. ### c) Explain what a C++ pointer is and how 'pointer arithmetic' works. [4 marks]\\n\\nA C++ pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable. Pointers are powerful tools in C++ that allow direct memory access and manipulation. They are used for dynamic memory allocation, array manipulation, and implementing data structures like linked lists. - **Pointer Arithmetic**: This involves performing operations on pointers to navigate through memory. For example, if `p` is a pointer to an integer array, `p + 1` moves the pointer to the next integer in the array. Pointer arithmetic takes into account the size of the data type being pointed to, so incrementing a pointer advances it by the size of the data type. ### d) A class has a private instance variable declared as:\\n```java\\nprivate ArrayList<Person> a;\\n```\\nand a public instance method with the statement:\\n```java\\nreturn a;\\n```\\nExplain why this might be a design problem and how the problem could be removed. [6 marks]\\n\\nReturning a private instance variable like `ArrayList<Person> a` directly from a public method can lead to several design issues:\\n\\n- **Encapsulation Violation**: It breaks encapsulation by exposing the internal representation of the class. External code can modify the list directly, potentially leading to unintended side effects. - **Data Integrity**: Direct access allows external modification, which can compromise the integrity of the data stored in the list. **Solution**:\\n- Return a copy of the list instead of the original. This can be done using:\\n  ```java\\n  return new ArrayList<>(a);\\n  ```\\n- Alternatively, provide methods to add, remove, or access elements, maintaining control over how the list is modified.\", \"This can be done using:\\n  ```java\\n  return new ArrayList<>(a);\\n  ```\\n- Alternatively, provide methods to add, remove, or access elements, maintaining control over how the list is modified. ### e) Write a method that takes two parameters, an array of integers and a single integer, and returns an array containing all the values in the parameter array that are exactly divisible (i.e., leave a remainder of zero) by the second integer parameter. The array returned should not have any unused elements. [10 marks]\\n\\nHere's a Java method to achieve this:\\n\\n```java\\npublic int[] getDivisibleValues(int[] numbers, int divisor) {\\n    // Temporary list to store divisible numbers\\n    ArrayList<Integer> divisibleNumbers = new ArrayList<>();\\n\\n    // Iterate through the array and check divisibility\\n    for (int number : numbers) {\\n        if (number % divisor == 0) {\\n            divisibleNumbers.add(number);\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    // Convert the ArrayList to an array\\n    int[] result = new int[divisibleNumbers.size()];\\n    for (int i = 0; i < divisibleNumbers.size(); i++) {\\n        result[i] = divisibleNumbers.get(i);\\n    }\\n\\n    return result;\\n}\\n```\\n\\n- **Explanation**: The method iterates over the input array, checks if each element is divisible by the given integer, and adds it to a temporary list if true. Finally, it converts the list to an array and returns it, ensuring no unused elements are present.\", 'Question 5\\n\\nQUESTION:\\n4.\\na) Method parameters are passed by value.

Explain what this means. In Java, when you pass a parameter to a method, you are passing a copy of the value. For primitive data types (like `int`, `double`, etc. ), this means the actual value is copied. For objects, the reference (memory address) is copied, not the object itself. This means changes to the object inside the method affect the original object, but reassigning the reference does not affect the original reference. ### b) Consider the statements:\\n```java\\ndouble d = 1;\\nint n = 4/1.0;\\n```\\n- `double d = 1;` is valid. The integer `1` is implicitly converted to `1.0`, a double. - `int n = 4/1.0;` is invalid. The expression `4/1.0` results in a double (`4.0`), and you cannot assign a double to an `int` without explicit casting.', '- `int n = 4/1.0;` is invalid. The expression `4/1.0` results in a double (`4.0`), and you cannot assign a double to an `int` without explicit casting. ### c) Give the Java code needed to declare and create a 10x10x10 array of integers and initialise each array element to 5. ```java\\nint[][][] array = new int[10][10][10];\\n\\n// Initialize each element to 5\\nfor (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\\n    for (int j = 0; j < 10; j++) {\\n        for (int k = 0; k < 10; k++) {\\n            array[i][j][k] = 5;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### d) Given two variables, `a` and `b`, of type `MyClass`, explain what happens when the statements below are evaluated:\\n- `if (a == b)`: This checks if `a` and `b` refer to the same object in memory (i.e., they have the same reference). - `if (a.equals(b))`: This checks if `a` and `b` are logically equivalent. The behavior depends on how the `equals` method is overridden in `MyClass`. ### e) Consider this recursive method:\\n```java\\npublic static void g(int i, int j) {\\n    if (i < j) {\\n        System.out.print(i + \" \");\\n        i++;\\n        g(i, j);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n**Output of method calls:**\\n- `g(5,5)`: No output, as `i` is not less than `j`. - `g(4,5)`: Outputs `4`. - `g(3,5)`: Outputs `3 4`. - `g(2,5)`: Outputs `2 3 4`. - `g(1,5)`: Outputs `1 2 3 4`. - `g(0,6)`: Outputs `0 1 2 3 4 5`. **Algorithm Description:**\\nThis method implements a simple recursive counting algorithm.', '- `g(0,6)`: Outputs `0 1 2 3 4 5`. **Algorithm Description:**\\nThis method implements a simple recursive counting algorithm. It prints numbers from `i` to `j-1`, incrementing `i` by 1 in each recursive call until `i` is no longer less than `j`.', \"Question 1\\n\\nQUESTION:\\nAnswer ALL of Part I and TWO questions from Part II\\n(Note that in all questions the Java code given in your answers does not have to be \\nsyntactically perfect but should, at least, be a good approximation.)

This encapsulation is a good practice. - **Constructor**: It initializes the fields with the values provided when a `SeniorMember` object is created. - **Getters**: These methods allow other classes to access the private fields if needed. #### f) Write a Java version of class `Society`\\n\\nFor the `Society` class, we need to create a class with a constructor that initializes the society's name.\", \"#### f) Write a Java version of class `Society`\\n\\nFor the `Society` class, we need to create a class with a constructor that initializes the society's name.

Calculators are NOT allowed. Java code given in your answers does not have to be syntactically perfect but should,\\nat least, be a good approximation. Section A\\nAnswer ALL of this Section\\n\\nANSWER:\\nTo solve this problem, we need to write Java code for the `Item` and `LightItem` classes based on the UML diagram provided. ### a) Class `Item`\\n\\nThe `Item` class is abstract and has a constructor and an abstract method `getShippingCost`. Here's how you can implement it:\\n\\n```java\\n// Abstract class Item\\npublic abstract class Item {\\n    // Attributes\\n    private String description;\\n    private int idCode;\\n\\n    // Constructor\\n    public Item(String description, int idCode) {\\n        this.description = description;\\n        this.idCode = idCode;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Abstract method to get the shipping cost\\n    public abstract int getShippingCost();\\n\\n    // Getter for description\\n    public String getDescription() {\\n        return description;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Getter for idCode\\n    public int getIdCode() {\\n        return idCode;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### b) Class `LightItem`\\n\\nThe `LightItem` class extends `Item` and implements the `getShippingCost` method, which returns a fixed cost of £1. ```java\\n// Class LightItem extending Item\\npublic class LightItem extends Item {\\n\\n    // Constructor\\n    public LightItem(String description, int idCode) {\\n        super(description, idCode);\\n    }\\n\\n    // Implementation of the abstract method getShippingCost\\n    @Override\\n    public int getShippingCost() {\\n        return 1; // Fixed cost of £1\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation\\n\\n- **Item Class:**\\n  - It's an abstract class because it contains an abstract method `getShippingCost`. - It has two private attributes: `description` and `idCode`. - The constructor initializes these attributes. - Abstract method `getShippingCost` is declared but not implemented. - **LightItem Class:**\\n  - It extends the `Item` class, meaning it inherits its attributes and methods.\", '- The constructor initializes these attributes. - Abstract method `getShippingCost` is declared but not implemented. - **LightItem Class:**\\n  - It extends the `Item` class, meaning it inherits its attributes and methods. - The constructor calls the superclass constructor using `super`. - It provides an implementation for the `getShippingCost` method, returning a fixed cost of £1. These implementations follow the UML diagram and the requirements specified in the question.', \"Question 2\\n\\nQUESTION:\\n1. Consider this UML class diagram:\\nOrder\\nItem\\n1\\n\\nANSWER:\\nTo address the questions based on the UML class diagram:\\n\\n### a) Java Version of Abstract Class `Item`\\n\\nThe `Item` class is abstract, which means it cannot be instantiated directly and may contain abstract methods. Here's how you can implement it in Java:\\n\\n```java\\npublic abstract class Item {\\n    private String description;\\n    private int idCode;\\n\\n    // Constructor\\n    public Item(String description, int idCode) {\\n        this.description = description;\\n        this.idCode = idCode;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Abstract method for shipping cost\\n    public abstract int getShippingCost();\\n\\n    // Getter for description\\n    public String getDescription() {\\n        return description;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Getter for idCode\\n    public int getIdCode() {\\n        return idCode;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### b) Java Version of Class `LightItem`\\n\\nThe `LightItem` class extends `Item` and has a fixed shipping cost of £1. Here's how you can implement it:\\n\\n```java\\npublic class LightItem extends Item {\\n\\n    // Constructor\\n    public LightItem(String description, int idCode) {\\n        super(description, idCode);\\n    }\\n\\n    // Implementing the abstract method from Item\\n    @Override\\n    public int getShippingCost() {\\n        return 1; // Fixed shipping cost of £1\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation\\n\\n- **Abstract Class `Item`:**\\n  - Contains private fields `description` and `idCode`. - Constructor initializes these fields. - Abstract method `getShippingCost()` must be implemented by subclasses. - Provides getters for `description` and `idCode`. - **Class `LightItem`:**\\n  - Extends `Item`, meaning it inherits its properties and methods. - Implements the `getShippingCost()` method, returning a fixed cost of £1. - Uses `super()` in the constructor to call the constructor of `Item`. This setup ensures that `LightItem` can be used to create objects with a predefined shipping cost, while `Item` serves as a base class for other potential item types.\", \"Question 3\\n\\nQUESTION:\\n0..* -description : String\\n+addltem( anltem : Item) : void\\n-idCode : int\\n+calculateShippingCostO\\n: int\\n+includeslfem( idCode: int): boolean\\n+gefShlppingCost() : tnt\\n+getDescriptionO : String\\n+getidCode() : int\\n. ,;\\nl';>\\nI\\nI\\nHeavyltem\\nLightltem\\n-weight: int\\n+getShippingCost() : int\\n+getShippingCost() : int\\n+getWeightO : int\\na) Class Item is an abstract class.

A strategy for testing the `Order`, `HeavyItem`, and `LightItem` classes could include:\\n\\n1. **Test Cases for `LightItem`:**\\n   - Create a `LightItem` and verify that `getShippingCost` returns 1. - Check that `getDescription` and `getIdCode` return the correct values. 2. **Test Cases for `HeavyItem`:**\\n   - Create a `HeavyItem` with a known weight and verify that `getShippingCost` returns the correct value (weight * 2). - Check that `getWeight`, `getDescription`, and `getIdCode` return the correct values. 3. **Test Cases for `Order`:**\\n   - Add multiple items to an `Order` and verify that `calculateShippingCost` returns the correct total. - Use `includesItem` to check for the presence of specific items by `idCode`. Using a testing framework like JUnit can automate these tests and ensure that changes to the code do not introduce new bugs.', \"Question 4\\n\\nQUESTION:\\n2.\\na) Concisely explain the following:\\nprotected, polymorphism,\\ngeneric method, final, static method, null\\n[2 marks each, total of 121\\nb) Write a Java class Queue that stores a queue of objects.

This makes it easier to understand, maintain, and extend. 2. **Encapsulation**: The class should hide its internal state and require all interaction to be performed through its methods. This protects the integrity of the data. 3. **Clear Interface**: The class should provide a clear and minimal interface for interacting with it. Methods should be intuitive and relevant to the class\\'s responsibility. 4. **High Cohesion**: All methods and properties should be closely related to the class\\'s main purpose. High cohesion means the class does one thing well. 5. **Low Coupling**: The class should have minimal dependencies on other classes.

The type is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to the variable. - Example:\\n  ```ruby\\n  x = 10      # x is an Integer\\n  x = \"Hello\" # x is now a String\\n  ```\\n\\n**Type Checking in Ruby vs. Java:**\\n\\n**Ruby:**\\n- **Dynamic Typing:** Type checking is done at runtime. - **Advantages:**\\n  - Flexibility: Easier to write and change code. - Conciseness: Less boilerplate code. - **Disadvantages:**\\n  - Runtime Errors: Type errors can occur during execution. - Performance: Slower due to runtime type checking. **Java:**\\n- **Static Typing:** Type checking is done at compile-time. - **Advantages:**\\n  - Early Error Detection: Type errors are caught during compilation. - Performance: Faster execution as types are known at compile-time. - **Disadvantages:**\\n  - Verbosity: More code is needed to declare types. - Rigidity: Less flexible in changing variable types. ### b) Explain what a C++ pointer is and compare pointers to references used by languages like Java and Ruby.', '- Rigidity: Less flexible in changing variable types. ### b) Explain what a C++ pointer is and compare pointers to references used by languages like Java and Ruby. **C++ Pointer:**\\n- A variable that stores the memory address of another variable. - Allows direct memory access and manipulation. - Example:\\n  ```cpp\\n  int x = 10;\\n  int* ptr = &x; // ptr holds the address of x\\n  ```\\n\\n**Pointers vs. References:**\\n\\n**Pointers (C++):**\\n- Can be reassigned to point to different addresses. - Can perform arithmetic operations. - Can be `nullptr`. **References (Java/Ruby):**\\n- Java uses references, not pointers. Ruby handles references implicitly. - References are safer as they do not allow direct memory manipulation. - In Java, references point to objects, and memory is managed by the garbage collector. ### c) Consider the implementation of a chained Hash Table class in Java. **i) Explain, with example code, the Java implementation of a chain. **\\n\\nIn a chained hash table, each bucket is a linked list (or another collection) that stores all entries with the same hash index. ```java\\nimport java.util.LinkedList;\\n\\nclass HashTable {\\n    private LinkedList<Entry>[] table;\\n    private int size;\\n\\n    public HashTable(int size) {\\n        this.size = size;\\n        table = new LinkedList[size];\\n        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {\\n            table[i] = new LinkedList<>();\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    static class Entry {\\n        String key;\\n        String value;\\n\\n        Entry(String key, String value) {\\n            this.key = key;\\n            this.value = value;\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**ii) Explain how a key/value pair is inserted into the hash table. **\\n\\n- Calculate the hash index using the key. - Insert the key/value pair into the linked list at that index.', '**\\n\\n- Calculate the hash index using the key. - Insert the key/value pair into the linked list at that index. ```java\\npublic void put(String key, String value) {\\n    int index = key.hashCode() % size;\\n    LinkedList<Entry> chain = table[index];\\n    for (Entry entry : chain) {\\n        if (entry.key.equals(key)) {\\n            entry.value = value; // Update existing key\\n            return;\\n        }\\n    }\\n    chain.add(new Entry(key, value)); // Add new key/value pair\\n}\\n```\\n\\n**iii) Explain how lookup is done, where a key is used to locate a value. **\\n\\n- Calculate the hash index using the key. - Search the linked list at that index for the key. ```java\\npublic String get(String key) {\\n    int index = key.hashCode() % size;\\n    LinkedList<Entry> chain = table[index];\\n    for (Entry entry : chain) {\\n        if (entry.key.equals(key)) {\\n            return entry.value; // Return the value if key is found\\n        }\\n    }\\n    return null; // Key not found\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis approach efficiently handles collisions by chaining entries in linked lists.', \"Question 1\\n\\nQUESTION:\\nCOMP1008 Object-Oriented Programming (2012)\\nAnswer ALL of SECTION A and TWO questions from SECTION B\\n(THREE questions in total)\\nMarks for each part of each question are indicated in square brackets. Calculators are NOT allowed. Java code given in your answers does not have to be syntactically perfect but should,\\nat least, be a good approximation. Section A\\nAnswer Question 1\\n\\nANSWER:\\nTo answer the question, let's break it down into parts:\\n\\n### a) Java Version of `ExecutiveTeam` Class\\n\\nThe `ExecutiveTeam` class needs to manage a collection of `Manager` objects. We'll use a `List` to store these managers. The class should have methods to add and remove managers. Here's a possible implementation:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\nimport java.util.List;\\n\\npublic class ExecutiveTeam {\\n    private List<Manager> managers;\\n\\n    // Constructor\\n    public ExecutiveTeam() {\\n        managers = new ArrayList<>();\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to add a manager to the team\\n    public void add(Manager manager) {\\n        managers.add(manager);\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to remove a manager by name\\n    public void remove(String name) {\\n        // Iterate through the list of managers\\n        for (int i = 0; i < managers.size(); i++) {\\n            // Check if the manager's name matches the given name\\n            if (managers.get(i).getName().equals(name)) {\\n                // Remove the manager from the list\\n                managers.remove(i);\\n                break; // Exit the loop after removing\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### b) Explanation of Abstract Class\\n\\n#### i) Role of an Abstract Class\\n\\nAn abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed. It can contain abstract methods (methods without a body) that must be implemented by subclasses, as well as concrete methods (methods with a body). **Role:**\\n- **Define a Template:** Abstract classes provide a common template for subclasses. They can define methods that are common to all subclasses, ensuring consistency. - **Partial Implementation:** They allow for partial implementation of a class, where some methods are implemented and others are left abstract for subclasses to complete. - **Encapsulation of Common Behavior:** Abstract classes encapsulate common behavior that can be shared among multiple subclasses, reducing code duplication.\", '- **Encapsulation of Common Behavior:** Abstract classes encapsulate common behavior that can be shared among multiple subclasses, reducing code duplication. In the UML diagram, `Employee` is an abstract class, meaning it provides a base structure for `Manager` and `Worker` classes, which will implement specific behaviors like `getMonthlyPay()`. This setup allows for polymorphism, where a `Company` can handle `Employee` objects without needing to know whether they are `Manager` or `Worker` objects.', \"Question 2\\n\\nQUESTION:\\n1.

We'll use a list to store these managers and implement the `add` and `remove` methods as described. Here's a possible implementation:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\nimport java.util.List;\\n\\npublic class ExecutiveTeam {\\n    // List to store managers\\n    private List<Manager> managers;\\n\\n    // Constructor\\n    public ExecutiveTeam() {\\n        managers = new ArrayList<>();\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to add a manager to the team\\n    public void add(Manager manager) {\\n        if (manager != null) {\\n            managers.add(manager);\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to remove a manager by name\\n    public void remove(String name) {\\n        // Iterate over the list to find the manager by name\\n        for (int i = 0; i < managers.size(); i++) {\\n            if (managers.get(i).getName().equals(name)) {\\n                managers.remove(i);\\n                break; // Exit after removing the manager\\n            }\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation:\\n\\n- **Constructor**: Initializes the `managers` list. - **`add` Method**: Adds a `Manager` to the list if it's not null. - **`remove` Method**: Iterates through the list to find a manager by name and removes them if found. ### b) Abstract Class `Employee`\\n\\n#### i) Role of an Abstract Class\\n\\nAn abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed.

[14 marks]\\n[Total 30 Marks]\\nCOMP1008\\n4\\nContinued\\n\\nANSWER:\\n### a) Explain any four of the following:\\n\\n1. **null**:\\n   - `null` is a special literal in Java that represents a null reference, meaning it points to no object. It is often used to indicate that a reference variable is not currently pointing to any object. Attempting to access methods or properties on a `null` reference will result in a `NullPointerException`. 2. **static variable**:\\n   - A `static` variable is shared among all instances of a class. It belongs to the class itself rather than any individual object. This means that if one object changes the value of a `static` variable, the change is reflected across all instances of the class. 3. **protected**:\\n   - The `protected` access modifier allows a member to be accessed within its own package and by subclasses. It provides a level of access control that is more restrictive than `public` but less restrictive than `private`. 4. **overloading**:\\n   - Method overloading occurs when multiple methods have the same name but different parameter lists within the same class. It allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, as long as their parameter types or numbers differ. 5.', 'It allows a class to have more than one method with the same name, as long as their parameter types or numbers differ. 5. **overriding**:\\n   - Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. The method in the subclass should have the same name, return type, and parameters as the method in the superclass. ### b) Consider a class VoteCounter\\n\\n#### i) Java class VoteException\\n\\n```java\\n// Custom exception class for invalid voting operations\\npublic class VoteException extends Exception {\\n    // Constructor that accepts a message\\n    public VoteException(String message) {\\n        super(message);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### ii) Java version of the VoteCounter class\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\nimport java.util.HashMap;\\nimport java.util.Map;\\n\\n// Class to count votes for different options\\npublic class VoteCounter {\\n    // Map to store vote counts for each option\\n    private Map<String, Integer> voteCounts;\\n\\n    // Constructor that initializes vote counts for each option\\n    public VoteCounter(ArrayList<String> options) {\\n        voteCounts = new HashMap<>();\\n        // Initialize each option with a vote count of zero\\n        for (String option : options) {\\n            voteCounts.put(option, 0);\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to add a vote for a given option\\n    public void voteFor(String option) throws VoteException {\\n        if (!voteCounts.containsKey(option)) {\\n            // Throw exception if option is invalid\\n            throw new VoteException(\"Invalid option: \" + option);\\n        }\\n        // Increment the vote count for the valid option\\n        voteCounts.put(option, voteCounts.get(option) + 1);\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to get the vote count for a given option\\n    public int getVoteCount(String option) throws VoteException {\\n        if (!voteCounts.containsKey(option)) {\\n            // Throw exception if option is invalid\\n            throw new VoteException(\"Invalid option: \" + option);\\n        }\\n        // Return the vote count for the valid option\\n        return voteCounts.get(option);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation:\\n\\n- **VoteException**: A custom exception class that extends `Exception` to handle invalid voting operations. - **VoteCounter**:\\n  - Uses a `HashMap` to store vote counts for each option. - The constructor initializes vote counts to zero for each option.', '- **VoteCounter**:\\n  - Uses a `HashMap` to store vote counts for each option. - The constructor initializes vote counts to zero for each option. - `voteFor` method increments the vote count for a valid option or throws `VoteException` if the option is invalid. - `getVoteCount` method returns the vote count for a valid option or throws `VoteException` if the option is invalid.', 'Question 6\\n\\nQUESTION:\\n4.\\na) Give the Java code needed to create an Ar.rayList containing ten\\nArray List objects, with each of the ten Array List objects containing ten\\ncopies of the string \"Hello\".

Changes to the parameter inside the method do not affect the original value. - When you pass an object (like an `ArrayList`) to a method, the reference to the object is copied. This means the method can modify the object itself, but it cannot change the reference to point to a new object. ### c) Validity of Statements\\n\\n1. `double d = 1 / 4;`\\n   - **Not valid as intended. ** This performs integer division, resulting in `0`, which is then stored as `0.0` in `d`. 2. `int n = d;`\\n   - **Not valid. ** You cannot directly assign a `double` to an `int` without explicit casting because of potential loss of precision. 3. `String s = \" \" + n;`\\n   - **Valid. ** This concatenates a space with the integer `n`, converting `n` to a string in the process.', '3. `String s = \" \" + n;`\\n   - **Valid. ** This concatenates a space with the integer `n`, converting `n` to a string in the process. ### d) Recursive Method Analysis\\n\\n#### i) Output of Method Calls\\n\\nThe method `f(n)` is a recursive function that calculates `2^(n-1)` for `n >= 1` and returns `1` for `n < 1`. - `f(0)`: 1\\n- `f(1)`: 1\\n- `f(2)`: 2\\n- `f(3)`: 4\\n- `f(4)`: 8\\n- `f(5)`: 16\\n\\n#### ii) Algorithm Implemented\\n\\nThe method implements the calculation of powers of 2, specifically `2^(n-1)` for `n >= 1`. #### iii) Re-write Using a Loop\\n\\nHere is how you can rewrite the recursive method using a loop:\\n\\n```java\\npublic static int f(int n) {\\n    if (n < 1) return 1;\\n    \\n    int result = 1;\\n    for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {\\n        result *= 2;\\n    }\\n    return result;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis loop calculates `2^(n-1)` by multiplying `result` by `2` for each iteration.'], 'uris': None, 'included': ['metadatas', 'documents'], 'data': None,
