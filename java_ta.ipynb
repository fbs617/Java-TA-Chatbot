       "  \"To address the questions, let's break down the UML diagram and the requirements:\\n\\n### a) Java version of class `ExecutiveTeam`\\n\\nThe `ExecutiveTeam` class has methods to add and remove managers. Here's how you can implement it:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\n\\npublic class ExecutiveTeam {\\n    private ArrayList<Manager> managers;\\n\\n    public ExecutiveTeam() {\\n        managers = new ArrayList<>();\\n    }\\n\\n    public void add(Manager manager) {\\n        managers.add(manager);\\n    }\\n\\n    public void remove(String name) {\\n        managers.removeIf(manager -> manager.getName().equals(name));\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### b) i) Role of an abstract class\\n\\nAn abstract class in Java is a class that cannot be instantiated on its own and is meant to be subclassed. It can have abstract methods (without a body) that must be implemented by subclasses, as well as concrete methods (with a body). Abstract classes are used to define a common template for a group of related classes.\\n\\n### b) ii) Java version of class `Employee`\\n\\nThe `Employee` class is abstract and includes a constructor to initialize its fields:\\n\\n```java\\npublic abstract class Employee {\\n    private String name;\\n    private String department;\\n    private int monthlyPay;\\n\\n    public Employee(String name, String department, int pay) {\\n        this.name = name;\\n        this.department = department;\\n        this.monthlyPay = pay;\\n    }\\n\\n    public String getName() {\\n        return name;\\n    }\\n\\n    public String getDepartment() {\\n        return department;\\n    }\\n\\n    public int getMonthlyPay() {\\n        return monthlyPay;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### c) Java version of class `Worker`\\n\\nThe `Worker` class extends `Employee` and uses its constructor:\\n\\n```java\\npublic class Worker extends Employee {\\n\\n    public Worker(String name, String department, int pay) {\\n        super(name, department, pay);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation\\n\\n- **`ExecutiveTeam`**: Uses an `ArrayList` to manage `Manager` objects. The `remove` method uses a lambda expression to find and remove a manager by name.\\n- **`Employee`**: Abstract class with fields for name, department, and pay. It provides a constructor and getter methods.\\n- **`Worker`**: Concrete class extending `Employee`, using the superclass constructor to initialize its fields.\\n\\nThis structure follows the UML diagram and the requirements specified in the question.\"),\n",

Errors are caught early.\\n- **Dynamic Typing**: Type checking at runtime. More flexible but can lead to runtime errors.\\n\\n#### c) Recursive Method Analysis\\n\\n##### i) Advantages and Disadvantages of Recursion\\n\\n- **Advantages**:\\n  - Simplifies code for problems that have a recursive nature (e.g., tree traversal).\\n  - Can be more intuitive for problems like factorials or Fibonacci sequences.\\n\\n- **Disadvantages**:\\n  - Higher memory usage due to stack frames.\\n  - Can lead to stack overflow if recursion depth is too high.\\n  - Sometimes less efficient than iterative solutions.\\n\\n##### ii) Output of Method Calls\\n\\nThe recursive method doubles the result for each increment in `n`.\\n\\n- `f(0)`: Returns 1 (base case).\\n- `f(1)`: Returns `f(0) + f(0)` = 1 + 1 = 2.\\n- `f(2)`: Returns `f(1) + f(1)` = 2 + 2 = 4.\\n- `f(3)`: Returns `f(2) + f(2)` = 4 + 4 = 8.\\n- `f(4)`: Returns `f(3) + f(3)` = 8 + 8 = 16.\\n- `f(5)`: Returns `f(4) + f(4)` = 16 + 16 = 32.'),\n",

This allows for early error detection and often results in more optimized code.\\n\\n- **Dynamic Typing:** Dynamically typed languages determine the type of a variable at runtime, offering more flexibility but potentially leading to runtime errors.\\n\\n### c) Consider this recursive method:\\n\\n```java\\npublic static int f(int n)  \\n{ \\n  if (n < 1) { return 1 ; } \\n  else { return f(n-1) + f(n-1) ; } \\n}\\n```\\n\\n#### i) List the advantages and disadvantages of using recursion with an object-oriented language like Java.\\n[4 marks]\\n\\n**Advantages:**\\n- **Simplicity:** Recursive solutions can be more intuitive and easier to implement for problems that have a natural recursive structure.\\n- **Readability:** Recursive code can be more readable and concise, making it easier to understand.\\n\\n**Disadvantages:**\\n- **Performance:** Recursive methods can be less efficient due to the overhead of multiple function calls and stack usage.\\n- **Stack Overflow:** Deep recursion can lead to stack overflow errors if the recursion depth exceeds the stack limit.\\n- **Debugging:** Recursive code can be harder to debug and trace due to multiple function calls.\\n\\n#### ii) Give the output of the following method calls: f(0), f(1), f(2), f(3), f(4), f(5).\\n[6 marks]\\n\\n- **f(0):** 1\\n- **f(1):** 2\\n- **f(2):** 4\\n- **f(3):** 8\\n- **f(4):** 16\\n- **f(5):** 32\\n\\nThe function doubles the result of `f(n-1)`.\\n\\n#### iii) State what algorithm the method implements.\\n[2 marks]\\n\\nThe method implements a form of exponential growth calculation, specifically calculating \\\\(2^n\\\\).\\n\\n#### iv) Re-write the method to use a loop instead of recursion.\\n[5 marks]\\n\\nHere is a loop-based version of the method:\\n\\n```java\\npublic static int f(int n) {\\n    int result = 1;\\n    for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {\\n        result *= 2;\\n    }\\n    return result;\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis loop iteratively doubles the result, achieving the same effect as the recursive method.\"), ('Question 4', '3. Consider a method that takes a parameter of type ArrayList<Integer> and returns an \\nArrayList<Integer> containing all the integer values from 0 to 100 inclusive that are \\nnot in the parameter ArrayList. \\n \\nNote that ArrayList has a method contains(n) that returns true if the value n is \\ncontained in the ArrayList. \\n \\n    i) Write a pseudo-code (English language description) version of the \\n    method to show how your implementation of the method should work.  \\n[6 marks] \\n \\n    ii) Write the method in Java. \\n[9 marks] \\n[Total 15 marks]', \"To solve this problem, we need to create a method that identifies which integers from 0 to 100 are not present in a given `ArrayList<Integer>`. Let's break it down:\\n\\n### i) Pseudo-code\\n\\n1. **Initialize an empty ArrayList** called `missingNumbers` to store integers not found in the input list.\\n2. **Loop through integers** from 0 to 100:\\n   - For each integer `i` in this range:\\n     - **Check if `i` is not in the input ArrayList** using the `contains` method.\\n     - If `i` is not present, **add `i` to `missingNumbers`**.\\n3. **Return `missingNumbers`**.\\n\\nThis pseudo-code outlines a straightforward approach to solving the problem using iteration and conditional checks.\\n\\n### ii) Java Method\\n\\nHere's how you can implement the above logic in Java:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\n\\npublic class MissingNumbersFinder {\\n    public static ArrayList<Integer> findMissingNumbers(ArrayList<Integer> inputList) {\\n        ArrayList<Integer> missingNumbers = new ArrayList<>();\\n\\n        // Loop through numbers 0 to 100\\n        for (int i = 0; i <= 100; i++) {\\n            // Check if the number is not in the input list\\n            if (!inputList.contains(i)) {\\n                // Add the number to the missingNumbers list\\n                missingNumbers.add(i);\\n            }\\n        }\\n\\n        // Return the list of missing numbers\\n        return missingNumbers;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Explanation\\n\\n- **ArrayList Initialization**: We start by creating an empty `ArrayList<Integer>` called `missingNumbers` to store numbers that are not in the input list.\\n- **Loop**: We use a `for` loop to iterate through numbers from 0 to 100.\\n- **Condition Check**: For each number, we use the `contains` method of `ArrayList` to check if the number is not present in the input list. If it's not present, we add it to `missingNumbers`.\\n- **Return Statement**: Finally, we return the `missingNumbers` list, which contains all numbers from 0 to 100 that are not in the input list.\\n\\nThis method efficiently checks each number in the specified range and compiles a list of those that are missing, using the `contains` method to verify presence in the input list.\"), ('Question 5', '4. A class VoteCounter should record the number of votes for each of a number of options, \\nand have the following methods: \\n• A constructor that takes an ArrayList<String> of option names as a parameter. \\nThe vote count for each option is set to zero. \\n• A method voteFor takes an option name as a parameter and adds one vote for that \\noption.

It will have a constructor to initialize the vote counts and methods to vote for an option and get the vote count.\\n\\nHere\\'s a possible implementation:\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\nimport java.util.HashMap;\\n\\npublic class VoteCounter {\\n    private HashMap<String, Integer> voteCounts;\\n\\n    public VoteCounter(ArrayList<String> options) {\\n        voteCounts = new HashMap<>();\\n        for (String option : options) {\\n            voteCounts.put(option, 0);\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    public void voteFor(String option) throws VoteException {\\n        if (!voteCounts.containsKey(option)) {\\n            throw new VoteException(\"Invalid option: \" + option);\\n        }\\n        voteCounts.put(option, voteCounts.get(option) + 1);\\n    }\\n\\n    public int getVoteCount(String option) throws VoteException {\\n        if (!voteCounts.containsKey(option)) {\\n            throw new VoteException(\"Invalid option: \" + option);\\n        }\\n        return voteCounts.get(option);\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n- **Explanation**:\\n  - **Constructor**: Takes an `ArrayList<String>` of option names and initializes a `HashMap` to store vote counts, setting each count to zero.\\n  - **voteFor Method**: Takes an option name, checks if it exists in the `HashMap`, and increments the vote count. Throws a `VoteException` if the option is invalid.\\n  - **getVoteCount Method**: Returns the vote count for a given option. Throws a `VoteException` if the option is invalid.\\n\\nThis implementation uses a `HashMap` to efficiently manage and access vote counts by option name. The exception handling ensures that only valid options can be voted for or queried.')]\n"

      "Brief Summary\n",
      "Java provides three types of loops: while, do-while, and for loops, each serving different purposes for repeating code execution.\n",
      "\n",
      "Detailed Explanation\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **While Loop**\n",
      "   - **Syntax**: \n",
      "     ```java\n",
      "     while (boolean-expression) {\n",
      "         // Loop body\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - **Behavior**: The loop body executes zero or more times as long as the boolean expression evaluates to true.\n",
      "   - **Example**:\n",
      "     ```java\n",
      "     int counter = 0;\n",
      "     while (counter < 10) {\n",
      "         System.out.println(\"Hello \" + counter);\n",
      "         counter++;\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - **Use Case**: Suitable when the number of iterations is not known beforehand.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Do-While Loop**\n",
      "   - **Syntax**:\n",
      "     ```java\n",
      "     do {\n",
      "         // Loop body\n",
      "     } while (boolean-expression);\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - **Behavior**: The loop body executes at least once, and then continues as long as the boolean expression is true.\n",
      "   - **Example**:\n",
      "     ```java\n",
      "     int counter = 0;\n",
