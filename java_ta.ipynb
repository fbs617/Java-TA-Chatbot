      "Java provides three types of loops: the while loop, the do-while loop, and the for loop, each serving different purposes and use cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **While Loop**: \n",
      "   - The while loop repeatedly executes a block of statements as long as a specified boolean expression evaluates to true. \n",
      "   - The loop body can be executed zero or more times, depending on the condition.\n",
      "   - Syntax:\n",
      "     ```java\n",
      "     while (boolean-expression) {\n",
      "       // Loop body\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - Example:\n",
      "     ```java\n",
      "     int counter = 0;\n",
      "     while (counter < 10) {\n",
      "       System.out.println(\"Hello \" + counter);\n",
      "       counter++;\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Do-While Loop**:\n",
      "   - The do-while loop is similar to the while loop, but it guarantees that the loop body will be executed at least once, as the condition is evaluated after the loop body.\n",
      "   - Syntax:\n",
      "     ```java\n",
      "     do {\n",
      "       // Loop body\n",
      "     } while (boolean-expression);\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - Example:\n",
      "     ```java\n",
      "     int counter = 0;\n",
      "     do {\n",
      "       System.out.println(\"Hello \" + counter);\n",
      "       counter++;\n",
      "     } while (counter < 10);\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **For Loop**:\n",
      "   - The for loop is typically used for counting and iterating over a range of values.\n",
      "   - It consists of three parts: initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.\n",
      "   - Syntax:\n",
      "     ```java\n",
      "     for (init-exp; test-exp; exp) {\n",
      "       // Loop body\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - Example:\n",
      "     ```java\n",
      "     for (int counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++) {\n",
      "       System.out.println(\"Hello \" + counter);\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Enhanced For Loop**:\n",
      "   - Also known as the \"for-each\" loop, it is used to iterate over elements of arrays or collections.\n",
      "   - Syntax:\n",
      "     ```java\n",
      "     for (type element : array) {\n",
      "       // Loop body\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - Example:\n",
      "     ```java\n",
      "     int[] array = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n",
      "     for (int n : array) {\n",
      "       System.out.println(n);\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "\n",
      "Additionally, Java provides control statements like `break` and `continue` to manage loop execution:\n",
      "- **Break**: Exits the loop immediately.\n",
      "- **Continue**: Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration of the loop.\n"

      " Polymorphism in Java refers to the ability of a single function or method to operate on different types, or the ability of objects of different classes to respond to the same method calls. This concept allows for a single piece of code to work with multiple values and objects, promoting code reuse and flexibility.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the context of inheritance, polymorphism allows a superclass reference to point to objects of its subclass. This means that a method defined in a superclass can be overridden in a subclass to provide specific behavior, and the correct method is called at runtime based on the actual object type, a process known as dynamic binding.\n",
      "\n",
      "The benefits of polymorphism in inheritance include:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Code Reusability**: It allows for writing more generic and reusable code. A single method can operate on objects of different classes that share a common superclass.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Flexibility and Maintainability**: It enables the design of flexible systems that can be easily extended and maintained. New subclasses can be added with minimal changes to existing code.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Substitutability**: It allows objects of different subclasses to be treated as objects of a common superclass, enabling the use of common interfaces and reducing the need for type-specific code.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, polymorphism enhances the object-oriented design by allowing for more abstract and flexible code structures.\n",

      " I don't have specific quiz questions and answers in the provided context, but I can help you generate a quiz based on the key concepts mentioned in the context related to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). Here are five questions along with their answers for review:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Question:** What is the purpose of using interfaces in Java, and how do they differ from abstract classes?\n",
      "   - **Answer:** Interfaces in Java are used to define a contract that classes can implement. They specify methods that must be implemented by any class that implements the interface. Unlike abstract classes, interfaces cannot have any method implementations (prior to Java 8), and a class can implement multiple interfaces, allowing for multiple inheritance of type. Abstract classes, on the other hand, can have method implementations and can only be extended by one subclass.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Question:** Explain the concept of generics in Java and provide an example of how they can be used.\n",
      "   - **Answer:** Generics allow you to create classes, interfaces, and methods with a placeholder for the type of data they operate on. This provides type safety by ensuring that you only use the specified type, reducing runtime errors. For example, a generic class `Box<T>` can be used to store objects of any type `T`, such as `Box<Integer>` or `Box<String>`.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Question:** What is method overriding in Java, and why is it useful?\n",
      "   - **Answer:** Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation for a method that is already defined in its superclass. It is useful because it allows a subclass to provide a specific behavior for a method that is different from the superclass, enabling polymorphism. This means that a subclass can be used interchangeably with its superclass, but it will execute the overridden methods.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Question:** Describe the role of exceptions in Java and how they are used in error handling.\n",
      "   - **Answer:** Exceptions in Java are used to handle errors and other exceptional events. They provide a way to transfer control from one part of a program to another. Java provides a robust exception handling mechanism with try-catch blocks, allowing developers to catch exceptions and handle them gracefully, rather than letting the program crash. This improves program stability and user experience.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Question:** What is the Iterable interface in Java, and how does it enhance the functionality of a class?\n",
      "   - **Answer:** The Iterable interface in Java is used to represent a collection of objects that can be iterated over. It requires implementing the `iterator()` method, which returns an Iterator object. Implementing Iterable allows a class to be used in enhanced for loops (for-each loops) and with Streams, making it easier to traverse and manipulate collections of objects.\n",

      " A hash table is a data structure that provides a way to store and retrieve data efficiently using key-value pairs. The key is processed through a hash function, which computes an index in an array where the value is stored. This allows for fast data retrieval, as ideally, the hash function distributes keys uniformly across the array, minimizing collisions.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are two common techniques to handle collisions (when two keys hash to the same index): chaining and open addressing.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Chaining**: This method involves storing multiple elements at the same index using a linked list. When a collision occurs, the new element is added to the list at that index. For example, in a `ChainedHashTable`, if two keys hash to the same index, both values are stored in a linked list at that index.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Open Addressing (Linear Probing)**: Instead of using a linked list, this method searches for the next available slot in the array. If a collision occurs, the algorithm linearly searches for the next empty slot. This is implemented in a `LinearHashTable`.\n",
      "\n",
      "Here's a simple example using a chained hash table:\n",
      "\n",
      "```java\n",
      "HashTable<String, Integer> table = new ChainedHashTable<String, Integer>();\n",
      "table.put(\"One\", 1);\n",
      "table.put(\"Two\", 2);\n",
      "assert table.get(\"One\") == 1; // Retrieves the value 1\n",
      "assert table.get(\"Three\") == null; // Returns null as \"Three\" is not in the table\n",
      "table.put(\"One\", 3); // Updates the value for key \"One\" to 3\n",
      "assert table.get(\"One\") == 3; // Retrieves the updated value 3\n",
      "table.remove(\"One\"); // Removes the key \"One\" from the table\n",
      "assert table.get(\"One\") == null; // Now returns null as \"One\" has been removed\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "In this example, the `ChainedHashTable` is used to store integer values with string keys. The `put` method adds or updates key-value pairs, `get` retrieves the value associated with a key, and `remove` deletes a key-value pair from the table.\n"
