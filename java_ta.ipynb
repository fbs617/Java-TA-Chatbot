      "     while (boolean-expression) {\n",
      "         // Loop body\n",
      "     }\n",
      "     ```\n",
      "   - **Behavior**: The loop body executes zero or more times as long as the boolean expression evaluates to true.\n",
      "   - **Example**:\n",
      "     ```java\n",
      "     int counter = 0;\n",
      "     while (counter < 10) {\n",

      "2. **Do-While Loop**\n",

      "     } while (boolean-expression);\n",

      "Answer:\n",
      " Brief Summary\n",
      "Java supports three main types of loops: `while`, `do-while`, and `for` loops, each with specific use cases and behavior.\n",
      "\n",
      "Detailed Explanation\n",
      "\n",
      "### While Loop\n",
      "- **Syntax**: \n",
      "  ```java\n",
      "  while (boolean-expression) {\n",
      "      // Loop body\n",
      "  }\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "- **Behavior**: The loop body is executed zero or more times. The `boolean-expression` is evaluated before each iteration, and if it evaluates to `true`, the loop body executes. Otherwise, the loop terminates.\n",
      "- **Example**:\n",
      "  ```java\n",
      "  int counter = 0;\n",
      "  while (counter < 10) {\n",
      "      System.out.println(\"Hello \" + counter);\n",
      "      counter++;\n",
      "  }\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "  This loop prints \"Hello\" followed by numbers 0 to 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Do-While Loop\n",
      "- **Syntax**:\n",
      "  ```java\n",
      "  do {\n",
      "      // Loop body\n",
      "  } while (boolean-expression);\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "- **Behavior**: The loop body is executed one or more times. The `boolean-expression` is evaluated after each iteration.\n",
      "- **Example**:\n",
      "  ```java\n",
      "  int counter = 0;\n",
      "  do {\n",
      "      System.out.println(\"Hello \" + counter);\n",
      "      counter++;\n",
      "  } while (counter < 10);\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "  This loop also prints \"Hello\" followed by numbers 0 to 9, but guarantees at least one execution of the loop body.\n",
      "\n",
      "### For Loop\n",
      "- **Syntax**:\n",
      "  ```java\n",
      "  for (init-exp; test-exp; exp) {\n",
      "      // Loop body\n",
      "  }\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "- **Behavior**: Typically used for counting. The `init-exp` initializes the loop variable, `test-exp` is evaluated before each iteration, and `exp` is executed after each iteration.\n",
      "- **Example**:\n",
      "  ```java\n",
      "  for (int counter = 0; counter < 10; counter++) {\n",
      "      System.out.println(\"Hello \" + counter);\n",
      "  }\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "  This loop prints \"Hello\" followed by numbers 0 to 9.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Enhanced For Loop\n",
      "- **Syntax**:\n",
      "  ```java\n",
      "  for (int n : array) {\n",
      "      // Loop body\n",
      "  }\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "- **Behavior**: Used for iterating over arrays or collections. The loop variable `n` takes each value in the array in turn.\n",
      "- **Example**:\n",
      "  ```java\n",
      "  int[] numbers = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};\n",
      "  for (int n : numbers) {\n",
      "      System.out.println(n);\n",
      "  }\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "  This loop prints each number in the `numbers` array.\n",
      "\n",
      "### Control Statements\n",
      "- **Break**: Exits the loop immediately.\n",
      "  ```java\n",
      "  while (true) {\n",
      "      if (condition) {\n",
      "          break;\n",
      "      }\n",
      "  }\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "- **Continue**: Skips the current iteration and proceeds to the next one.\n",
      "  ```java\n",
      "  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {\n",
      "      if (i % 2 == 0) {\n",
      "          continue;\n",
      "      }\n",
      "      System.out.println(i);\n",
      "  }\n",
      "  ```\n",
      "\n",
      "Edge Cases & Pitfalls\n",
      "- Ensure the loop has a proper termination condition to avoid infinite loops.\n",
      "- Be cautious with the loop counter to prevent off-by-one errors.\n",
      "- Remember that the enhanced for loop cannot be used to modify the array elements directly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Optional Extras\n",
      "- **Mini Quiz**: What will happen if the `test-exp` in a `for` loop is always `true`? (Answer: The loop will run indefinitely unless a `break` statement is used.)\n"
