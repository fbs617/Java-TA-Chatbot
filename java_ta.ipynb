       "  \"Let's tackle each part of the question step by step.\\n\\n### a) Abstract Class `Item`\\n\\nThe `Item` class is abstract with a constructor and an abstract method `getShippingCost`. Here's how you can implement it in Java:\\n\\n```java\\npublic abstract class Item {\\n    private String description;\\n    private int idCode;\\n\\n    // Constructor\\n    public Item(String description, int idCode) {\\n        this.description = description;\\n        this.idCode = idCode;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Abstract method to be implemented by subclasses\\n    public abstract int getShippingCost();\\n\\n    // Getter for description\\n    public String getDescription() {\\n        return description;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Getter for idCode\\n    public int getIdCode() {\\n        return idCode;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### b) Class `LightItem`\\n\\nThe `LightItem` class extends `Item` and has a fixed shipping cost of £1.\\n\\n```java\\npublic class LightItem extends Item {\\n\\n    // Constructor\\n    public LightItem(String description, int idCode) {\\n        super(description, idCode);\\n    }\\n\\n    // Implementing the abstract method from Item\\n    @Override\\n    public int getShippingCost() {\\n        return 1; // Fixed cost of £1\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### c) Class `HeavyItem`\\n\\nThe `HeavyItem` class extends `Item` and calculates shipping cost based on weight.\\n\\n```java\\npublic class HeavyItem extends Item {\\n    private int weight;\\n\\n    // Constructor\\n    public HeavyItem(int weight, String description, int idCode) {\\n        super(description, idCode);\\n        this.weight = weight;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Implementing the abstract method from Item\\n    @Override\\n    public int getShippingCost() {\\n        return 2 * weight; // £2 per kilogram\\n    }\\n\\n    // Getter for weight\\n    public int getWeight() {\\n        return weight;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### d) Class `Order`\\n\\nThe `Order` class manages a collection of `Item` objects and calculates the total shipping cost.\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\\nimport java.util.List;\\n\\npublic class Order {\\n    private List<Item> items;\\n\\n    // Constructor\\n    public Order() {\\n        items = new ArrayList<>();\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to add an item to the order\\n    public void addItem(Item anItem) {\\n        items.add(anItem);\\n    }\\n\\n    // Calculate total shipping cost of the order\\n    public int calculateShippingCost() {\\n        int totalCost = 0;\\n        for (Item item : items) {\\n            totalCost += item.getShippingCost();\\n        }\\n        return totalCost;\\n    }\\n\\n    // Check if an item with the given idCode is in the order\\n    public boolean includesItem(int idCode) {\\n        for (Item item : items) {\\n            if (item.getIdCode() == idCode) {\\n                return true;\\n            }\\n        }\\n        return false;\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### e) Unit Testing Strategy\\n\\n**Unit Testing** is a software testing method where individual units or components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as expected.\\n\\n**Testing Strategy:**\\n\\n1. **Test Initialization:**\\n   - Ensure that objects of `LightItem` and `HeavyItem` are correctly initialized with the given parameters.\\n\\n2. **Test `getShippingCost`:**\\n   - For `LightItem`, verify that `getShippingCost` returns 1.\\n   - For `HeavyItem`, verify that `getShippingCost` returns `2 * weight`.\\n\\n3. **Test `Order` Class:**\\n   - Add multiple `Item` objects to an `Order` and verify that `calculateShippingCost` returns the correct total.\\n   - Test `includesItem` to ensure it correctly identifies whether an item with a specific `idCode` is in the order.\\n\\n4. **Edge Cases:**\\n   - Test with no items in the order.\\n   - Test with items having the same `idCode`.\\n\\nBy following this strategy, you can ensure that the classes behave as expected under various conditions.\"),\n",

       "  '### a) Concisely explain the following:\\n\\n1. **Protected**:\\n   - A Java access modifier that allows access to the members of a class within its own package and by subclasses. It provides more accessibility than private but is more restrictive than public.\\n\\n2. **Polymorphism**:\\n   - A core concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class. The most common use is method overriding, where a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.\\n\\n3. **Generic Method**:\\n   - A method that is written with a single method declaration and can be called with arguments of different types. The compiler ensures type safety by checking the types at compile time.\\n\\n4. **Final**:\\n   - A keyword in Java that can be used with classes, methods, and variables. A final class cannot be subclassed, a final method cannot be overridden, and a final variable\\'s value cannot be changed once initialized.\\n\\n5. **Static Method**:\\n   - A method that belongs to the class rather than any specific instance of the class. It can be called without creating an instance of the class and can only access static data.\\n\\n6. **Null**:\\n   - A special literal in Java that represents a reference that points to no object. It is used to indicate that a reference variable does not currently refer to any object.\\n\\n### b) Write a Java class Queue\\n\\n```java\\nimport java.util.LinkedList;\\nimport java.util.NoSuchElementException;\\n\\npublic class Queue {\\n    private LinkedList<Object> elements;\\n    private int maxLength;\\n\\n    // Constructor to initialize the queue with a maximum length\\n    public Queue(int maxLength) {\\n        this.maxLength = maxLength;\\n        this.elements = new LinkedList<>();\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to add an object to the end of the queue\\n    public void add(Object obj) throws IllegalStateException {\\n        if (elements.size() >= maxLength) {\\n            throw new IllegalStateException(\"Queue is full\");\\n        }\\n        elements.addLast(obj);\\n    }\\n\\n    // Method to remove and return the object at the front of the queue\\n    public Object remove() throws NoSuchElementException {\\n        if (elements.isEmpty()) {\\n            throw new NoSuchElementException(\"Queue is empty\");\\n        }\\n        return elements.removeFirst();\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### c) Example code to use the Queue class\\n\\n```java\\npublic class QueueExample {\\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\\n        Queue queue = new Queue(3);\\n\\n        try {\\n            // Adding elements to the queue\\n            queue.add(\"First\");\\n            queue.add(\"Second\");\\n            queue.add(\"Third\");\\n\\n            // Attempt to add another element to a full queue\\n            queue.add(\"Fourth\");\\n        } catch (IllegalStateException e) {\\n            System.out.println(e.getMessage()); // Output: Queue is full\\n        }\\n\\n        try {\\n            // Removing elements from the queue\\n            System.out.println(queue.remove()); // Output: First\\n            System.out.println(queue.remove()); // Output: Second\\n            System.out.println(queue.remove()); // Output: Third\\n\\n            // Attempt to remove an element from an empty queue\\n            System.out.println(queue.remove());\\n        } catch (NoSuchElementException e) {\\n            System.out.println(e.getMessage()); // Output: Queue is empty\\n        }\\n    }\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThis code demonstrates adding and removing elements from the queue, and it shows how exceptions are thrown when trying to add to a full queue or remove from an empty queue.'),\n",

       "  'Sure, let\\'s break down each part of the question.\\n\\n### a) Ruby is a dynamically typed language\\n\\n**Dynamic Typing in Ruby:**\\n- In Ruby, variables do not have a fixed type. The type is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to the variable.\\n- Example: \\n  ```ruby\\n  x = 10      # x is an Integer\\n  x = \"Hello\" # x is now a String\\n  ```\\n\\n**Type Checking in Ruby vs. Java:**\\n\\n- **Ruby (Dynamic Typing):**\\n  - **Advantages:**\\n    - Flexibility: You can easily change the type of a variable.\\n    - Conciseness: Less code is needed since you don\\'t declare types.\\n  - **Disadvantages:**\\n    - Runtime Errors: Type-related errors are caught only at runtime, which can lead to bugs that are harder to track.\\n    - Performance: Dynamic typing can be slower because type checking is done at runtime.\\n\\n- **Java (Static Typing):**\\n  - **Advantages:**\\n    - Early Error Detection: Type errors are caught at compile time, reducing runtime errors.\\n    - Performance: Static typing can lead to optimized performance since types are known at compile time.\\n  - **Disadvantages:**\\n    - Verbosity: More code is needed to declare types.\\n    - Inflexibility: Once a type is set, it cannot be changed without explicit casting.\\n\\n### b) C++ Pointers vs. Java/Ruby References\\n\\n**C++ Pointers:**\\n- A pointer is a variable that stores the memory address of another variable.\\n- Example:\\n  ```cpp\\n  int a = 10;\\n  int* ptr = &a; // ptr holds the address of a\\n  ```\\n\\n**Pointers vs. References:**\\n\\n- **C++ Pointers:**\\n  - **Advantages:**\\n    - Direct Memory Access: Allows manipulation of memory addresses.\\n    - Flexibility: Can point to different variables or be null.\\n  - **Disadvantages:**\\n    - Complexity: Can lead to errors like null pointer dereferencing and memory leaks.\\n\\n- **Java/Ruby References:**\\n  - **Advantages:**\\n    - Safety: No direct access to memory addresses, reducing errors.\\n    - Simplicity: Easier to use since they automatically handle memory management.\\n  - **Disadvantages:**\\n    - Less Control: Cannot manipulate memory directly.\\n\\n### c) Chained Hash Table in Java\\n\\n**i) Java Implementation of a Chain:**\\n\\n- A chain in a hash table is typically implemented using a linked list.\\n- Example:\\n  ```java\\n  class HashNode<K, V> {\\n      K key;\\n      V value;\\n      HashNode<K, V> next;\\n\\n      public HashNode(K key, V value) {\\n          this.key = key;\\n          this.value = value;\\n          this.next = null;\\n      }\\n  }\\n  ```\\n\\n**ii) Inserting a Key/Value Pair:**\\n\\n- Calculate the hash index for the key.\\n- Traverse the chain at that index.\\n- If the key exists, update the value.\\n- If not, add a new node at the end of the chain.\\n- Example:\\n  ```java\\n  public void put(K key, V value) {\\n      int index = getHashIndex(key);\\n      HashNode<K, V> head = chainArray[index];\\n\\n      while (head != null) {\\n          if (head.key.equals(key)) {\\n              head.value = value;\\n              return;\\n          }\\n          head = head.next;\\n      }\\n\\n      head = chainArray[index];\\n      HashNode<K, V> newNode = new HashNode<>(key, value);\\n      newNode.next = head;\\n      chainArray[index] = newNode;\\n  }\\n  ```\\n\\n**iii) Lookup Using a Key:**\\n\\n- Calculate the hash index for the key.\\n- Traverse the chain at that index.\\n- If the key is found, return the value.\\n- If not, return null or indicate the key doesn\\'t exist.\\n- Example:\\n  ```java\\n  public V get(K key) {\\n      int index = getHashIndex(key);\\n      HashNode<K, V> head = chainArray[index];\\n\\n      while (head != null) {\\n          if (head.key.equals(key)) {\\n              return head.value;\\n          }\\n          head = head.next;\\n      }\\n      return null;\\n  }\\n  ```\\n\\nThis explanation covers the key concepts and provides example code to illustrate the implementation of a chained hash table in Java.')]"
